Low-severity wildfires typically result in minor organic matter loss. The impacts of such fires on the hydrological and geochemical dynamics of peat plateau-wetland complexes have not been examined. In 2014, a low-severity wildfire, with minimal ground surface damage, burned approximately one-half of a 5 ha permafrost plateau in the wetland-dominated landscape of the Scotty Creek watershed, Northwest Territories, Canada, in the discontinuous permafrost zone. In March 2016, hydrometeorological and permafrost conditions on the burned and unaffected plateaus were monitored including snowpack characteristics and surface energy dynamics. Pore water samples were collected from the saturated layer as thaw progressed throughout the growing season on the burned and unaffected plateaus. Repeated probing of the frost table depth was coupled with laboratory analyses of peat physical and hydraulic characteristics performed on peat cores collected from the top 20 cm of the ground surface in the burned and unaffected plots. The higher transmissivity of the burned forest canopy accelerated snowmelt promoting earlier onset of the thawing season and increased the ground heat flux to melt ground ice. Wildfire increased the thickness of the supra-permafrost layer, including the active layer and talik, resulting in a more uniform subsurface with limited depressional storage capacity and reduced preferential runoff flowpaths across the burned plateau. The incorporation of ash and char into the peat matrix reduced pore diameters, promoting greater subsurface soil moisture retention and longer pore water residence times ultimately providing greater opportunity for soil water interaction and biogeochemical reactions. Consequently, pore water showed elevated dissolved solutes, dissolved organic matter and mercury concentrations in the burned site. Low-severity wildfires have the potential to trigger a series of complex, inter-related hydrological, thermal and biogeochemical processes and feedbacks.","2021-08-15","2025-01-08 20:46:18","2025-02-08 18:26:36","","","","","782","","Sci.

Peatlands role as carbon (C) sink is dependent on both anoxic conditions and low temperatures that limit SOM decomposition. Previous studies have shown that elevated temperatures due to climate change can disrupt peatland's C balance by enhancing SOM decomposition and increasing CO2 emissions. However, little is known about how SOM decomposition pathways change at higher temperatures. Here, we used an integrated research approach to investigate the mechanisms behind enhanced CO2 emissions and SOM decomposition under elevated temperatures of surface peat soil collected from a raised and Sphagnum dominated mid-continental bog (S1 bog) peatland at the Marcel Experimental Forest in Minnesota, USA, incubated under oxic conditions at three different temperatures (4, 21, and 35 °C). Our results indicated that elevated temperatures could destabilize peatland's C pool via a combination of abiotic and biotic processes. In particular, temperature-driven changes in redox conditions can lead to abiotic destabilization of Fe-organic matter (phenol) complexes, previously an underestimated decomposition pathway in peatlands, leading to increased CO2 production and accumulation of polyphenol-like compounds that could further inhibit extracellular enzyme activities and/or fuel the microbial communities with labile compounds. Further, increased temperatures can alter strategies of microbial communities for nutrient acquisition via changes in the activities of extracellular enzymes by priming SOM decomposition, leading to enhanced CO2 emission from peatlands. Therefore, coupled biotic and abiotic processes need to be incorporated into process-based climate models to predict the fate of SOM under elevated temperatures and to project the likely impacts of environmental change on northern peatlands and CO2 emissions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2022","2025-01-08 20:46:19","2025-03-07 18:27:30","","","","","804","","Sci.

Restoration work included not only the blockage of drainage ditches, but also the reintroduction of plant material including Sphagnum remains. Following restoration, the physicochemical and microbial characteristics (biomass, activity and composition) of the peat were analysed. The goal was to investigate the functional status of the restored ecosystem. The high N:P (> 20) and N:K (> 15) ratios indicated possible K and P deficiencies in the restored and the cutover sites, which is mainly associated with the intense leaching and the high degree of decomposition of the peat in these sites. The concentrations of NH4+, P and K in the top layer of the restored site were closer to those of the natural site, which indicated a possible effect of restoration on the physicochemistry of the restored site. Microbial biomass values derived from the FE technique followed a gradient natural > restored > cutover through the profile, which was not the case with the SIR technique. Values from SIR varied overall between 0.19 and 4.88 mg C g(-1) and were significantly higher in the natural site. The natural peatland site had significantly (P < 0.05) greater cumulative C-CO2 production (surface aerobic: 4.5-8.7 mu g C-CO2 g(-1) h(-1)). The poor organic matter quality was the main explanation for the low respiration rates of the surface layer in the restored and the cutover site. All CO2 respiration data were plotted against time and the resulting curves were successfully fitted to a global kinetic model. Methane production was detected at low but measurable rates in the natural and the restored samples, but not in the cutover peat. Overall, the results confirmed the existence of a lag between the positive response of vegetation to restoration and that of the microbial compartment. This study also pointed out that some physicochemical dysfunctions remained even after three growing seasons following restoration in the subsurface horizons studied.","2006-06","2025-01-08 20:46:19","2025-03-17 18:44:38","","1375-1387","","6","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","9.7","1","SC: 0000132","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents the early results of carbon and nutrient dynamics following the large scale restoration of a post-extraction peatland.

Under natural conditions, direct oxidation of Cr(III) by O2 is very unfavorable, and a critical determinant of Cr(VI) generation in soil and groundwater is the interaction between chromite and Mn(II) or Mn(III/IV) oxides. Here, the effects of Mn(II) or Mn(IV) on the oxidative dissolution of chromite were investigated at pH values of 5, 7 and 9 during anoxic, oxic and anoxic-oxic processes. The results showed that the direct oxidation of Cr(III) by O2 was slow in aqueous-phase system, while the Mn oxides in chromite could oxidize dissolved Cr(III). The added Mn(II) can be catalytically oxidized to MnOOH on the chromite surface only under alkaline oxidation conditions, and the catalytic efficiency is slow, which has less effect on chromite oxidative dissolution. Compared with the direct oxidation of O2 and catalytic oxidation of Mn(II), the synthesized biogenic Mn oxides drove the oxidative dissolution of chromite to release more Cr(VI) and were the main threat to the long-term stability of chromite in the environment. Overall, both acidic and alkaline environments are favorable to the catalytic oxidation of chromite by O2, Mn(II) and δ-MnO2, while neutral conditions are favorable to the long-term stability of chromite. These above processes may occur in soils and sediments with redox fluctuations (e.g., rice paddies, river floodplains, wetlands, and peatlands), and the presence of Mn(II) and Mn(III/IV) may play an important role in the oxidation and mobilization of Cr(III), leading to elevated Cr(VI) levels in soils and groundwater. © 2023","2024","2025-01-08 20:46:19","2025-03-07 22:07:12","","","","","349","","J.

Location: Lake 979, Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario, Canada. Methods: A boreal basin peatland complex with treed bog, open bog, and open water was experimentally flooded by raising water level ca. 1.3 m. Vegetation and above-ground biomass were compared between pre-flood conditions and those nine years after flooding. Peat accumulation since flooding was also quantified. Results: Flooding caused almost all trees to die, leading to a net loss of 86% of the above-ground living plant biomass after nine years of the flooding. Floating up of peat was rapid in the central part of the basin, and the floating peat mats were characterized by newly established open bog community. Wetland types were diversified from bog into open bog, fen, and marsh, accompanied with great species turnover. Floating open bog community accumulated the greatest amount of peat since flooding. Conclusions: This study shows that shallow flooding of bog vegetation can lead to quick re-establishment of open bog vegetation upon the floating up of peat mats as well as changes to more diverse vegetation over decadal time spans. We estimate that the carbon pools in 2002 in living and dead plant biomass since 1992 are comparable to what they were in the above-ground biomass in 1992. Flooding caused an initial net decrease in carbon stores, but carbon in the pre-flood living plant biomass was replaced by both carbon in dead biomass of the pre-flood vegetation and newly sequestered carbon in new peat growth and post-flood living plant biomass. Possible vegetation change toward bog-dominated system could lead to increasing rate of new peat growth, which could affect future carbon sink/source strength of the system.","2005-11","2025-01-08 20:46:19","2025-03-07 22:07:53","","199-208","","2","8","","Applied Vegetation Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.8","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the impact of experimental shallow flooding on the vegetation of a boreal basin bog peatland.

Peatland restoration efforts are being increasingly undertaken yet effective monitoring of landscape-scale restoration projects has been limited. A particular gap in our understanding is the length of time required before a site reaches the target state. To address this, a classification model based on remote sensing data was developed for a peatland restoration area on blanket bog in northern Scotland, UK, to evaluate whether post-restoration trajectories followed predictable trends over time. The model was trained against a chronosequence of sites within a 20 x 10 km study area that are being restored following drainage and intensive non-native afforestation. Two versions of the model were created to compare the accuracy obtainable from the suite of Sentinel-2 satellite data versus sub-metre resolution aerial imagery from GetMapping (RGB and IR). The Sentinel-2 based model greatly outperformed the aerial imagery-based model. Adding surface slope to the classification did not significantly improve the accuracy of prediction. Prediction of starting and target land covers was very robust, and both the most recent and oldest restoration sites were well predicted spatially. The main uncertainties in the model were within sites of intermediate restoration age, and sites which underwent additional treatments after the initial restoration. Using standard vegetation and wetness indices as indicators, it was possible to track the progression of areas that had been felled and rewetted towards the spectral signal of the control blanket bog locations. A further study examined the use of multiple years of satellite data (2015-2021) and including Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, and confirmed the findings obtained with only a single climatically average year, and furthermore examined the efficacy of different restoration methods. We observed consistent trends of restoration sites beginning to resemble the target hydrologically and ecologically functional blanket bog state after 10-20 years post intervention.","2023-05-03","2025-01-08 20:46:19","2025-03-12 17:51:41","","2885-2911","","9","44","","Int.

However, it is uncertain how long-term water table alterations will alter C dynamics in northern peatlands because most studies have focused on short-term water table manipulations. The goal of our study was to quantify the effect of long-term water table changes (~80 years) on gaseous C fluxes in a peatland in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Chamber methods were utilized to measure ecosystem respiration (ER), gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and methane (CH4) fluxes in a peatland experiencing levee induced long-term water table drawdown and impoundment in relation to an unaltered site. Inundation raised water table levels by approximately ~10 cm and resulted in a decrease in ER and GPP, but an increase of CH4 emissions. Conversely, the drained sites, with water table levels ~15 cm lower, resulted in a significant increase in ER and GPP, but a decrease in CH4 emissions. However, NEE was not significantly different between the water table treatments. In summary, our data indicates that long-term water table drawdown and inundation was still altering peatland gaseous C fluxes, even after 80 years. In addition, many of the patterns we found were of similar magnitude to those measured in short-term studies, which indicates that short-term studies might be useful for predicting the direction and magnitude of future C changes in peatlands.","2014-02-01","2025-01-08 20:46:19","2025-03-07 18:21:18","","35-47","","1","22","","Wetlands Ecol.

However, expansion of resource exploration and extraction combined with warmer temperatures associated with climate change may result in reduced water availability to these peatland complexes, potentially disrupting peatland hydrological connectivity and hydrogeochemical cycling. A case study on the effects of reduced water availability on peatland hydrological and geochemical function was conducted near the De Beers Victor Diamond Mine, located 90 km west of Attawapiskat. Active dewatering occurred here over a 12-year period (2007-2019) during which a 1.5 km transect was monitored within the mine impacted radius. Hydrological (streamflow and groundwater levels) and chemical (porewater and surface water samples) parameters were collected at the impacted transect and two nearby unimpacted reference sites. Results demonstrated that impacted peatlands had depleted water storage and spent an average of 50 % less time hydrologically connected than unimpacted peatlands. By the end of the study period, increasingly depleted water storage within the dewatering radius resulted in disproportionately lower flowrates in two tributaries downgradient of the mine-impacted peatlands when compared with the reference sites. Moreover, diminished water storage allowed solute-depleted precipitation to reach greater depths within the peat profile, while stronger downwards gradients suppressed upwards flow into fens, limiting the amount of solute-enriched water reaching the surface. The recovery of fen solute concentrations will be a prolonged process (i.e., decades to centuries) due to the slow rate of upwards diffusion, which may result in the transition of these systems towards ombrotrophic bogs. Further studies should focus on the susceptibility of these impacted systems to further reductions in water availability due to climate change.","2024-02-25","2025-01-08 20:46:19","2025-03-07 18:20:14","","","","","913","","Sci.

In the event of a release, a thorough understanding of solute transport within the saturated zone is necessary to predict plume fate and the potential impacts on peatland ecosystems. To better characterize contaminant transport in these systems, approximately 13,000 L/day of sodium chloride tracer (200 mg/L) was released into a bog in the James Bay Lowland. The tracer was pumped into a fully penetrating well (1.5 m) between July 5 and August 18, 2015. Horizontal and vertical plume development was measured via in situ specific conductance and water table depth from an adaptive monitoring network. Over the spill period, the bulk of the plume travelled a lateral distance of 100 m in the direction of the slight regional groundwater and topographical slope. The plume shape was irregular and followed the hollows, indicating preferential flow paths due to the site microtopography. Saturated transport of the tracer occurred primarily at approximately 25 cm below ground surface (bgs), and at a discontinuous high hydraulic conductivity layer approximately 125 cm bgs due to a complex and heterogeneous vertical hydraulic conductivity profile. Plume measurement was confounded by a large amount of precipitation (233 mm over the study period) that temporarily diluted the tracer in the highly conductive upper peat layer. Longitudinal solute advection can be approximated using local water table information (i.e., depth and gradient); microtopography; and meteorological conditions. Vertical distribution of solute within the peat profile is far more complex due to the heterogeneous subsurface; characterization would be aided by a detailed understanding of the site-specific peat profile; the degree of decomposition; and the type of contaminant (e.g., reactive/nonreactive). The results of this research highlight the difficulty of tracking a contaminant spill in bogs and provide a benchmark for the characterization of the short-term fate of a plume in these complex systems.

High volume dewatering associated with resource extraction in this area, such as the De Beers Victor Diamond Mine, tests the ability of the underlying confining layer to limit water losses in the peatlands above. This research quantifies the deepening of water tables and increase in effective stress related to mine dewatering and the resulting changes to bog and fen peatland hydrophysical structure and function. Long-term implications of these impacts are discussed. One impacted and two unimpacted transects were instrumented for meteorological (precipitation and evapotranspiration) and hydrophysical (hydraulic head, hydraulic conductivity (K-sat), and surface elevation) monitoring over a 12-year period in the vicinity of the Victor Mine. Over this study period, the unimpacted peatlands operated within relative hydrological equilibrium, demonstrated through shallow water tables, negligible subsidence, and stable K-sat. Contrastingly, all impacted peatlands experienced deeper watertables, larger downwards gradients, and measurable long-term subsidence (4-15 cm). Hydrological impacts were highest in bogs with a thin underlying confining layer even if they were farther from the point of dewatering, highlighting the need for environmental monitoring programs which incorporate an assessment of aquitard thickness. Where subsidence occurred, associated decreases in K-sat deflected bog-fen-tributary flow-paths deeper, reducing the upwards transport of solute rich water to downgradient fens. The long-term effects of these landscape scale changes should be studied further, particularly since climate change in this region will potentially increase water deficits and further alter peatland connectivity. Peatland studies should be conducted in different landscapes experiencing water table lowering due to drought or depressurization in order to better understand the associated subsidence patterns and hydrophysical changes in varying geological and morphological regimes.","2023-01-10","2025-01-08 20:46:20","2025-03-07 22:07:56","","","","","855","","Sci.

Global warming has raised concerns about the C sink strength of northern environments. In the vast peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) region of Canada, warming-induced changes in sea ice dynamics over the Bay have altered its advective influence on the adjacent lowlands. Despite our knowledge of the short-term C exchange in these peatlands, there remain uncertainties in the long-term combined response of GPP and ER to climate change. In this study, the satellite-data-driven Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model was employed to investigate the response of peatland GPP, ER, and net ecosystem exchange to temperature and moisture changes. The results show contrasting net CO2 exchange at the two peatland sites over the last 20 years, with the fen acting as a net C source (+24 g C m-2) to the atmosphere and the bog serving as a net C sink (-130 g C m-2). There is ample evidence that a warmer and wetter climate enhanced GPP more than ER, while cooler temperatures weakened the peatland net C sink, regardless of the moisture conditions. Additionally, the advective influence of Hudson Bay on the lowlands produced markedly different C dynamics between offshore and onshore winds, with higher respiration rates (12%-26%) during offshore winds. We discuss the implications for peatland C balance under more frequent onshore winds in the region. Peatlands in northern environments play a vital role in the climate system by storing large amounts of carbon and helping to mitigate climate change. Understanding how peatlands respond to climatic changes is essential for accurate climate projections and informing climate policy decisions. In the vast peatlands of the HBL region of Canada, global warming and changes in sea ice over the Bay have affected the surrounding lowlands. We used satellite data to study how temperature and moisture changes impact carbon exchange in these peatlands. Over the past 20 years, we found that one peatland site released carbon into the atmosphere while another absorbed carbon. Warmer and wetter conditions increased plants' carbon uptake more than carbon release by respiration. In contrast, cooler temperatures weakened the peatland's ability to store carbon, regardless of soil moisture levels. The Hudson Bay's influence on the lowlands led to different carbon dynamics depending on wind direction, with higher respiration rates during offshore (land) winds than winds blowing from the Bay. Our findings have implications for understanding carbon balance in peatlands under changing climate conditions, especially considering the potential for more frequent onshore winds in the region. Fen and bog sites in the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) showed contrasting net CO2 exchange over the last 20 years. Peatland carbon exchange varies with climate anomalies, with warmer and wetter conditions increasing photosynthesis more than respiration.

To further develop remote sensing-based measurements of peatland moisture characteristics, we employed coincident surface reflectance and moisture measurements in two Sphagnum moss-dominated peatland sites. We applied the Mexican hat continuous wavelet transform to the measured spectra to generate wavelet features and coefficients across a range of scales. Overall, wavelet analysis was an improvement over the previously tested spectral indices at both the study sites. Linear mixed effect models for WT height using wavelet features accounted for more of the variance with both an improved marginal R<sup>2</sup> (29% greater) and a larger conditional R<sup>2</sup> (21% greater) compared to the best performing spectral index. While spectral indices performed similarly with wavelet coefficients for moisture content measured at 3 cm depth, they performed poorly for volumetric moisture content measured at 7 cm depth.

Methanogenic community structure was analysed through Illumina amplicon sequencing of the mcrA gene. Whether metal-contaminated sites were included or not, metal concentrations in peat were a primary driver of methanogenic community composition, particularly nickel, a trace element required in the F430 cofactor in methyl-coenzyme M reductase that is also toxic at high concentrations. Copper was also a strong predictor, likely due to inhibition at toxic levels and/or to cooccurrence with nickel, since copper enzymes are not known to be present in anaerobic archaea. The methanogenic groups Methanocellales and Methanosarcinales were prevalent in peatlands with low nickel concentrations, while Methanomicrobiales and Methanomassiliicoccales were abundant in peatlands with higher nickel concentrations.

We investigated functional traits related to growth and decomposition in Sphagnum species. We tested the importance of environment and phylogeny in driving species traits and investigated trade-offs among them. We selected 15 globally important Sphagnum species, representing four sections (subgenera) and a range of peatland habitats. We measured rates of photosynthesis and decomposition in standard laboratory conditions as measures of innate growth and decay potential, and related this to realized growth, production, and decomposition in their natural habitats. In general, we found support for a trade-off between measures of growth and decomposition. However, the relationships are not strong, with r ranging between 0.24 and 0.45 for different measures of growth versus decomposition. Using photosynthetic rate to predict decomposition in standard conditions yielded R2 = 0.20. Habitat and section (phylogeny) affected the traits and the trade-offs. In a wet year, species from sections Cuspidata and Sphagnum had the highest production, but in a dry year, differences among species, sections, and habitats evened out. Cuspidata species in general produced easily decomposable litter, but their decay in the field was hampered, probably due to near-surface anoxia in their wet habitats. In a principal components analysis, PCA, photosynthetic capacity, production, and laboratory decomposition acted in the same direction. The species were imperfectly clustered according to vegetation type and phylogeny, so that some species clustered with others in the same section, whereas others clustered more clearly with others from similar vegetation types. Our study includes a wider range of species and habitats than previous trait analyses in Sphagnum and shows that while the previously described growth–decay trade-off exists, it is far from perfect. We therefore suggest that our species-specific trait measures offer opportunities for improvements of peatland ecosystem models. Innate qualities measured in laboratory conditions translate differently to field responses. Most dramatically, fast-growing species could only realize their potential in a wet year. The same species decompose fast in laboratory, but their decomposition was more retarded in the field than that of other species. These relationships are crucial for understanding the long-term dynamics of peatland communities.","2016","2025-01-08 20:46:21","2025-03-07 18:21:13","","3325-3341","","10","6","","Ecol.

We measured length growth and net primary production (NPP) of two abundant Sphagnum species across 99 Holarctic peatlands. We tested the importance of previously proposed abiotic and biotic drivers for peatland carbon uptake (climate, N deposition, water table depth and vascular plant cover) on these two responses. Employing structural equation models (SEMs), we explored both indirect and direct effects of drivers on Sphagnumgrowth. Variation in growth was large, but similar within and between peatlands. Length growth showed a stronger response to predictors than NPP. Moreover, the smaller and denser Sphagnum fuscum growing on hummocks had weaker responses to climatic variation than the larger and looser Sphagnum magellanicum growing in the wetter conditions. Growth decreased with increasing vascular plant cover within a site. Between sites, precipitation and temperature increased growth for S. magellanicum. The SEMs indicate that indirect effects are important. For example, vascular plant cover increased with a deeper water table, increased nitrogen deposition, precipitation and temperature. These factors also influenced Sphagnum growth indirectly by affecting moss shoot density. Synthesis. Our results imply that in a warmer climate,S. magellanicumwill increase length growth as long as precipitation is not reduced, while S. fuscum is more resistant to decreased precipitation, but also less able to take advantage of increased precipitation and temperature.

The establishment of permanent anthropogenic linear features such as logging roads in the landscape may be a major factor in the predator-prey system. Logging roads may potentially improve the numerical and functional response of predators. Using camera traps, our objective was to explain according to local and landscape factors how the number of uses by wolves, black bears, lynx and moose, varies along different natural and anthropogenic linear features during the snow-free season. In western Quebec (Canada), the managed forest south of Val-d'Or encloses an isolated caribou population facing extinction that requires active restoration of their habitat. In this site, we used stratified random selection of gravel forest roads (n = 33), winter forest roads (n = 28) and riparian areas (n = 19) to compare their characteristics and number of uses by the four species. For wolves, black bears, and lynx, positive differences in lateral cover between the surroundings and the linear feature mainly explained their number of uses. Number of uses by wolves and lynx were positively related to use by their respective prey species (moose and snowshoe hare). Gray wolf use was also positively affected by distance to a higher forest road class and negatively affected by distance to the nearest urban area. Gravel forest roads had the highest number of uses by all species, as they showed greater positive differences in lateral cover as compared to the surroundings area due to their limited vegetation growth and by frequent maintenance activities. We recommend that restoration efforts aimed at forest road closures should target roads with a high value of difference in lateral cover, which is particularly the case in most gravel roads. Lower lateral cover on these linear feature as compared to their surroundings area favors the movement of predators and alternative prey. Our results thus suggest that investing in gravel roads restoration can benefit conservation efforts in caribou habitat.","2024-06","2025-01-08 20:46:21","2025-03-12 01:24:23","","","","","561","","For.

The sorption observed at pH 4.5 was acid-catalyzed dissociation of monothioarsenate, forming arsenite. The lower the pH and the more sulfhydryl sites, the more arsenite sorbed which in turn shifted equilibrium toward further dissociation of monothioarsenate. At pH 8.5, monothioarsenate was stable over 41 days. In conclusion, arsenic can be effectively sequestered by sulfhydryl groups in anoxic, slightly acidic environments where arsenite is the only arsenic species. At neutral to slightly alkaline pH, monothioarsenate can form and its slow transformation into arsenite and low affinity to sulfhydryl groups suggest that this species is mobile in such environments.","2018-07-03","2025-01-08 20:46:21","2025-02-08 18:42:25","","7317-7326","","13","52","","Environ.

Linear combination fittings of extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra showed that Sb binding to Fe phases was of minor importance and observed only in the uppermost layers of the peatland. Instead, the dominant (to almost exclusive) sequestration mechanism was Sb(III) binding to oxygen-containing functional groups, and at greater depths, increasingly Sb(III) binding to thiol groups of NOM. Aqueous Sb speciation was dominated by antimonate, while antimonite concentrations were low, further supporting our findings of much higher reactivity of Sb(III) than Sb(V) toward peat surfaces. Insufficient residence time for efficient reduction of antimonate to antimonite currently hinders higher Sb removal in the studied peatland.

Iterative target factor analysis allowed exclusion of reduced inorganic Sb–sulfur phases with similar Sb–sulfur distances.

Large chromite reserves have recently been discovered in the so-called Ring of Fire, Canada. Due to the strategic importance of uninterrupted stainless steel production in North America, it is highly likely that these reserves will be exploited in the foreseeable future. However, the Ring of Fire is located in an area that forms part of the largest peatland in the world, as well as the traditional territories of several First Nations (indigenous American communities), which highlights the environmental and social sensitive nature of the intended developments. In this review, relevant mining and/or smelting processes were considered within the context of possible prevention and mitigation of hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), formation, and the treatment of possible Cr(VI) containing waste materials. Cr(VI) is classified as a carcinogen and it has several negative environmental impacts. Prior to commencing chromite mining in the Ring of Fire, baseline studies should be undertaken to determine the possible natural occurrence of Cr(VI) in soils, untreated chromite ore and surface/groundwater, as well as sources thereof. During mining and ore processing, dry milling was identified as the only process step with the potential to generate Cr(VI); therefore, it should be avoided. Instead, wet milling should be used. Assessments of all process steps associated with conventional ferrochrome production indicated that smelting will lead to the formation of unintended small amounts of Cr(VI) (mg.kg−1 concentration range), irrespective of the technology applied. However, this review proved that it will be possible to produce ferrochrome without causing occupational/community health issues related to Cr(VI), as well as environmental pollution, if appropriate preventative and mitigation measures are applied. Apart from Cr(VI) related considerations, it is acknowledged that factors such as physical and chemical characteristics of the ore, capital and operational costs, specific electricity consumption, carbon footprint, and availability of expertise will determine what process options will be implemented. © 2017","2017","2025-01-08 20:46:21","2025-03-13 19:21:25","","874-889","","","165","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11.1","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the risk of pollution by metals, especially chromium VI, by the proposed mining operations in the Ring of Fire and mitigation to avoid toxic metal pollution.

To document this process, monitoring concepts must be found that are as operational, cost-effective and non-invasive as possible for the new sensitive ecosystems. The monitoring of the developing plant communities using multisensory Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data has great potential. We investigated two fen sites in north-eastern Germany that were rewetted in the late 1990s. The areas were flown with a Fixed-Wing UAV and three sensors (RGB, multispectral, thermal). A multisensor dataset consisting of the sensor data, plant height and five spectral indices was classified with a random forest algorithm. The classification accuracies were 87.1 and 89.0% for 10 and 11 classes for the respective sites. Furthermore, the band importance was analyzed using the Gini index. Plant height in combination with the multispectral information were the most important variables. This study underlines the suitability of UAVs for monitoring spectrally similar vegetation because of their capability to generate 3D surface models using structure-from-motion methods and to carry different sensor systems. In addition, they can be used on a regional scale and mostly independent of cloud cover. Secondary results of the study are that the band importance can be determined by Random Forest algorithms even with few trees (e.g. 10 trees), because the order remains very stable independently of the number of trees.","2019-12-17","2025-01-08 20:46:21","2025-03-12 17:52:28","","9103-9125","","24","40","","Int.

Upland-wetland systems are relatively new in the constructed landscape and only two exist to date. The objective of this work is to understand the key hydrological changes post-management of a constructed peatland watershed and provide insight on the overall system function. Six years of hydrometric data are presented from the Sandhill Fen Watershed (SFW), a 52-ha upland-wetland catchment built on soft tailings with a pump system to provide fresh water, support drainage, and limit salinization. Wet years (seasonal precipitation > evapotranspiration) occurred in 2013, 2016 and 2018 and dry years (seasonal precipitation < evapotranspiration) occurred in 2014, 2015 and 2017 where wet years had large 5-, 10- and 100-year storms which were absent in dry years. Surface conductance and solar radiation explained most of the variation in ET fluxes. Changes in management practices drove many of the observed hydrological changes. Heavy management in 2013 muted water table (WT) responses to climate as inflow and outflow (via pumps) controlled WT response. After 2014, management efforts declined and hydrological exchanges were predominantly vertical, and saturated storage across the wetland increased. As a result, WT variability was tightly coupled to ET regardless of WT position relative to the ground surface, with greater changes related to deeper water tables, suggesting the absence of water conserving feedback mechanisms. Intra-watershed water movement was primarily towards the wetland from recharge areas in the upland swale, whereas surface runoff was rare and only occurred during extreme rain events and spring snowmelt. Peat properties were degraded compared to those observed in undisturbed peatlands, and natural stratification of the peat profile was absent. Results suggest that current conditions are not favorable for fen-peatland development as marsh-like conditions have developed, limiting water conserving functions and the ability to persist long-term in a changing climate.","2021","2025-01-08 20:46:21","2025-03-11 18:43:26","","","","","166","","Ecol.

As part of their legal requirements, oil companies must reclaim disturbed landscapes into functioning ecosystems. Despite considerable work establishing upland forests, only two pilot wetland-peatland systems integrated within a watershed have been constructed to date. Peatland reclamation is challenging as it requires complete reconstruction with few guidelines or previous work in this region. Furthermore, the variable sub-humid climate and salinity of tailings materials present additional challenges. In 2012, Syncrude Canada Ltd. constructed a 52-ha pilot upland-wetland system, the Sandhill Fen Watershed, which was designed with a pump and underdrain system to provide freshwater and enhance drainage to limit salinization from underlying soft tailings materials that have elevated electrical conductivity (EC) and Na+. The objective of this research is to evaluate the hydrochemical response of a constructed wetland to variations in hydrology and water management with respect to water sources, flow pathways and major chemical transformations in the three years following commissioning. Results suggest that active water management practices in 2013 kept EC relatively low, with most wetland sites + concentrations 1000 μS/cm in 2014 and >2000 μS/cm in 2015. The most notable change was the emergence of several Na+ enriched zones in the margins. Here, Na+ concentrations were two to three times higher than other sites. Stable isotopes of water support that the Na+ enriched areas arise from underlying process-affected water in the tailings, providing evidence of its upward transport and seepage under a natural hydrologic regime. In future years, salinity is expected to evolve in its flow pathways and diffusion, yet the timeline and extent of these changes are uncertain.","2019","2025-01-08 20:46:21","2025-03-12 12:53:55","","1445-1457","","","653","","Sci.

The settling of particulates from tailings water provides for extended duration pond treatment, but ammonia residuals are not satisfactorily reduced. This paper details the use of a free water surface wetland for the removal of ammonia prior to discharge to pristine receiving waters. The 2.5 ha wetland was operated in the unfrozen seasons, at a depth of about 30 cm and a hydraulic loading rate of 50 cm d(-1). The site was a former forested peatland, with the trees cut down, and logs and brush left in the wetland. Marsh vegetation consisted of Equisetum spp, Typha spp., and Carex spp. On average, inlet ammonia was 11.6 mg N L-1, and the outlet was 3.2 mg N L-1. Regulatory ammonia requirements for less than 10 mg N L-1 on both a monthly and daily basis were exceeded 70% of the time for wetland inlet waters, and only on one day in six years (i.e., 1997-2002) for wetland effluent waters. Removal rates for ammonia far exceeded those found in any other treatment wetland. The implied oxygen and carbon supplies to support this observed performance, according to traditional chemistry, were greater than those estimated for the wetland. An alternative autotrophic nitrification/denitrification mechanism appears more likely, due to lower demands for oxygen and carbon. Phosphorus removal was also exceptionally high, and to exceptionally low levels (9 mu g P L-1). Performance for all other constituents, including 31 metals and cyanide, was within permitted ranges and in accordance with other experiences.","2005","2025-01-08 20:46:22","2025-03-12 01:48:51","","176-198","","","","","","","","","","","Backhuys Publishers,","Leiden, The Netherlands","","","","","","","","SC: 0000023","<p>- This chapter presents the results of nutrient removal in a peatland treatment wetland at the Musselwhite gold mine in the Boreal Shield of the Far North of Ontario. </p>","","","Canada; Ontario; biogeochemistry; peatland; mining; nutrients; mineral processing; impact minimization; nutrient enrichment; treatment wetland; Boreal Shield; mitigation hierarchy; remediation; fertility change/contamination","","Vymazal, J.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The inundation likely was caused by a culvert blocked by beavers, and indicates the critical role of hydrologic patterns and processes for controlling vegetation composition, including tree growth patterns and mortality. The disturbance of peatlands by roads could be reduced or eliminated by improving road designs to include multiple culverts that cannot easily be blocked by debris or beavers, or underdrain systems that create more natural surface and ground water flow patterns.

Roads that bisect wetlands can alter their hydrologic connectivity on a local or landscape scale. These impacts were studied in a poor fen located 45 km south of Fort McMurray, Alberta, where a raised road was built across the northern fringe of the fen in 1977. Examination of the fen’s response to this impoundment provided insight into post-disturbance vegetation succession patterns and peatland development. The objectives of this study were to map the spatial and temporal extent of hydrological disturbance from road construction, to quantify the response of peatland vegetation to this disturbance and to determine the successional pathway of the system.     The study site is an 8 ha poor fen situated on Stoney Mountain (~740 masl), about 45 km south of Fort McMurray in the Athabasca oil sands region of northeastern Alberta. The dominant groundcover of the fen is Sphagnum moss, with Ericaceae shrubs and Picea mariana (black spruce) also abundant. Construction of the raised road began in 1977, and the fen now drains through a culvert built under the road in the northwest corner. Complete tree dieback occurred within 220 m up-gradient of the road.  Tree rings were used as a proxy for hydrological change, because depth to water table is the main limiting factor for growth in peatland trees. Forty-two living and dead black spruce trees in the peatland were sampled and used for analysis, and 18 in the surrounding upland hillslopes. Dead trees were cross-dated using a combination of the list method and skeleton plots, and verified with COFECHA. Tree ring chronologies were built in R, and correlation coefficients between climate and ring width index (RWI) values for each chronology were calculated in Dendroclim2002. Water table was measured weekly at three groundwater wells and bulk density of the peat was calculated at several locations across the fen. In sixteen 50 m2 (25x2 m) transects, recent moss growth was calculated by measuring the depth to the root crown of black spruce trees. Tree density and the age of saplings were also measured in these transects. Vegetation cover, along with several abiotic variables was measured in 279 1 m2  plots. Vegetation was analyzed in the statistics program R using Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling and Ward’s Minimum Variance cluster analysis.  The upland tree chronology had less ring width variability than the peatland tree chronologies, and the peatland RWI had a stronger relationship with climate than the upland RWI. After road construction, there is a positive relationship with temperature in the year of growth for living and dead trees, and a mixed response to precipitation especially in June and July. Most of the trees within 220 m up-gradient of the road died in 1989, and these are all located within an elevation of 83.5 cm relative to the culvert top. Temporal uniformity of dieback suggests a single flooding event in 1988 or 1989 that drowned these trees, and the relationship with elevation above the culvert suggests that its blockage caused the flooding. The impact of flooding from culvert blockage on fen tree cover underlines the importance of natural drainage patterns in controlling vegetation composition and peatland type.  High bulk density values below the surface and loose Sphagnum moss carpets contribute to low storativity close to the culvert in the most disturbed area of the fen, as evidenced by rapid flooding and drying. The abundance of saplings decreases towards the culvert. The average depth of recent moss growth was greater immediately up-gradient of the road (37.6 cm) compared with undisturbed areas (15.5 cm). Analysis of vegetation using non-metric multidimensional scaling reveals dominance of non-hummock forming species closest to the culvert. These data suggests that periodic blockage of the culvert leads to flooding in the immediate area that encourages non-hummock forming species of sedge and moss, making an unfavourable environment for black spruce germination. This cycle of hydrologic disturbance may be preventing some areas of the fen from regaining the original vegetation structure, with implications for the system’s development. Both tree growth and vegetation structure continue to be impacted by past flooding events caused indirectly by road construction, and directly by inadequate drainage through the culvert. Maintaining a natural hydrologic regime is integral to maintaining the function of a peatland. This research has implications for peatland construction projects in the Athabasca oil sands, and the design and maintenance of linear features in this region and nationally.","2015","2025-01-08 20:46:22","2025-02-25 14:22:10","","","78","","","","","","","","","","University of Waterloo","Waterloo","","","M.Sc.","","","","","","<p>- This thesis examioned the effect of road construction on the change in drainage patterns and flooding in a boreal peatland and the consequent impacts on vegetation and tree growth.</p>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; vegetation; vascular plants; water table; flooding; carbon cycle; primary productivity; impact minimization; roads; mitigation hierarchy; woody plants; graminoids; hydrological alteration; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"SAQDZLBY","thesis","2018","Bois-Charlebois, Mhaly","Les défis de la compensation écologique des impacts sur les milieux humides dans le nord du Québec : étude de cas en territoire Cri","","","","","https://archipel.uqam.ca/12259/","Translation: The increase in the global human population and the increase in industrial activities, such as mining, contribute to the alteration of ecosystems. Generally speaking, any natural resource development project should be designed to avoid impacts on the natural environment, mitigate unavoidable impacts, restore what can be restored, and compensate for residual impacts. Existing regulations on ecological compensation often advocate offsetting impacts on a wetland through measures that only affect wetlands, with little consideration for variations in different ecosystems, urban and industrial development, or the specific characteristics of users of the environment at the affected site. The guidelines proposed in Quebec, for example, apply better in the south of the province, where many wetlands have been destroyed in the past and where they are rarer, but less so in more northern regions where wetlands are numerous and not very threatened. The objective of this study was to determine how the development of wetland impact compensation scenarios based on ecosystem services would better address the environmental and social specificities of northern Quebec, compared to the guidelines of the Ministère du Développement durable, de l’Environnement, et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques. The study is based on the case of the Éléonore mine, located in Cree territory (Eeyou Istchee), which must compensate for the loss of more than 63 hectares of wetlands. A literature review and thematic analysis of 21 semi-directed interviews were used to conduct a gap analysis. This analysis led to an assessment of the current state and recent trends of 20 ecosystem services. Provisioning services, such as food and materials supply, were always mentioned first, and socio-cultural services, such as traditional activities, were also mentioned by most respondents. Some species, such as the Canada goose, moose, lake trout, beaver, caribou, hare, and lake sturgeon, have been identified as species of major importance to the Crees, and whose abundance and distribution on Eeyou Istchee should be monitored. The second part of this study presents some examples of compensation projects that could be developed following the recommendations of government guides and a brief analysis of the differences in the ecological and social characteristics of southern Quebec compared to northern Quebec. These results illustrated how the way to meet the objectives of ecological compensation is not the same depending on the location and that government directives are poorly adapted to the uses of the environment by the Crees. In order to better meet the objectives of ecological and social compensation, in a territory where wetlands are numerous and not very threatened, the following criteria are proposed: 1. Avoid jeopardizing an environment that is rarer than the destroyed environment and ensure the integrity, viability and resilience of the surrounding environments; 2. Consult users who have been affected by the impacts of the project and compensate them by maintaining or restoring lost, rare or declining ecosystem services; 3. Consider the territory at the local and regional scale, as well as the impact that time may have on lost and compensated ecosystem services; 4. Aim for the objective of no net loss of biodiversity; 5. Ecosystem services that are difficult or impossible to compensate using natural elements should be the subject of additional conservation actions. Finally, this study presents compensation scenarios adapted to the case under study and based on the deficiency analysis, which would make it possible to compensate for both the impacts on the environment and those on humans. For example, habitat developments favorable to certain key species made it possible to compensate for several services at once. Government directives and the results of this study would benefit from being used in a complementary manner.","2018","2025-01-08 20:46:22","2025-03-07 20:56:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université du Québec à Montréal and Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue","Montréal","","","M.A.","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis presents a case study of wetland offsetting for the Eléonore Mine in the Boreal Shield of central Québec. &nbsp;It points to the need to consider traditional use of species in any offsetting system.

Fen moss species and communities occur along a hummock-hollow gradient in natural ecosystems, but their resistance and resilience to different durations of submergence has yet to be tested. We asked what are the short- and long-term effects of submergence duration on four common boreal fen moss species and the implications for ecosystem resilience? Location: Rich fen near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Methods: To examine the effect of submergence duration on fen moss species and communities, we harvested and submerged monoculture plugs dominated by Hamatocaulis vernicosus, Sphagnum warnstorfii, Tomentypnum nitens and Aulacomnium palustre in the field under rich fen water for 1-8 weeks. After submergence, we planted the plugs in bare peat at the same site to evaluate the short- and long-term responses of each species and changes in moss community composition over time. Results: We found that moss species response to duration of submergence is not strictly related to their occurrence along a hummock-hollow gradient and that tolerant species maintain or restore moss cover. H. vernicosus was most tolerant to submergence of all durations, whereas S. warnstorfii was nearly eliminated by submergence. Over the long term, more tolerant species replaced less tolerant species, increasing diversity and moss community resilience. Overall, moss communities without S. warnstorfii were resilient to 4 weeks of submergence because T. nitens and H. vernicosus maintained dominance or established where the cover of less resilient species was limited. Conclusions: We show that moss species varied in their responses to submergence duration, resulting in shifts in community composition and long-term effects on community resilience with longer durations of submergence. This provides insight into how moss communities provide stability to peatlands in response to disturbance through shifts in community composition that support tolerant dominant species.","2018-03","2025-01-08 20:46:22","2025-10-02 13:39:45","","127-135","","2","29","","J.

Peatland reclamation is challenging, but approaches are now being tested to determine the feasibility of rebuilding these valuable ecosystems. To evaluate our design concept, a pilot reclamation fen and associated watershed was constructed in an oil sands mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta. We implemented a large-scale multifactorial field experiment to test the introduction of bryophytes and vascular plants by moss layer transfer (MLT), seeds, and nursery grown seedlings under wood-strand mulch and with a <i>Typha latifolia</i> removal treatment. Four years after planting, the MLT and <i>Juncus balticus </i>seedling treatment supported the highest bryophyte and vascular plant cover and species richness. Removal reduced <i>T. latifolia </i>cover but was not necessary in areas where seedlings or MLT were introduced as it may have been competitively excluded by the planted species. The most successful fen species to establish was <i>Carex aquatilis</i> that spread quickly but also reduced the cover and species richness of bryophytes and other vascular plants. Water level influenced species distributions, with near surface water tables supporting higher cover of <i>T. latifolia </i>and lower bryophyte and other vascular plant cover and species richness. Our research demonstrates that it is possible to establish and maintain fen bryophytes and vascular plants and limit <i>T. latifolia </i>invasion in a constructed fen. To prioritize fen plant species richness and bryophyte cover, future projects should design for lower water levels, select species tolerant of expected abiotic conditions, and introduce nurse plants such as <i>J. balticus</i>. This research is the first of its kind to evaluate a range of species introduction approaches and demonstrates that it is possible to establish fen plants in the post-mined landscape of Alberta.","2019","2025-01-08 20:46:22","2025-03-08 14:24:17","","11-22","","","130","","Ecol.

As no classical method of population management appears applicable in the context of peatlands, our aim was to determine the ability of three environmental factors to inhibit T. latifolia germination, namely peat type, shade level and moss cover. A split-plot experiment conducted in a growth chamber investigated the effects of three substrates (fibric peat, mesic peat and filter paper) and six shade levels (including total obscurity) on germination rates of <i>T. latifolia</i>. In a second, greenhouse experiment, the effect of three increments of moss cover (null, fragmented and full) growing on two peat types (fibric and mesic) was examined for six corresponding seedbeds. Our results show that peat type was the major factor affecting germination, as almost none occurred on fibric peat while germination rates reached 84% on mesic peat. However, germination on mesic peat decreased with increasing moss cover: the germination rate dropped from 36 +/- 3% on bare peat to 1 +/- 0% in full moss carpets. Germination of T. latifolia was initiated by very low light levels (as low as 6%) but was inhibited by total obscurity. The low pH of fibric peat as well as the modification of environmental factors (e.g. light or substrate access) by moss carpets appear to be factors explaining the results. Establishing a dense moss cover and digging pools to a depth that prevents the exposure of peat with a pH favorable to seed germination (above 4) might be efficient methods to reduce Typha latifolia invasions in restored peatland pools.

Hg in catchment soils as a source for aquatic Hg is poorly studied. Here we test if i) peatland soils produce more methylmercury (MeHg) than forest soils; ii) total Hg (THg) concentrations in top soils are determined by atmospheric inputs, while MeHg is produced in the soils; and iii) soil disturbance promotes MeHg production. In two small boreal catchments, previously used in a paired-catchment forest harvest manipulation study, forest soils and peatlands were sampled and analysed for Hg species and additional soil chemistry. In the undisturbed reference catchment, soils were sampled in different vegetation types, of varying productivity as reflected in tree density, where historical data on precipitation and throughfall Hg and MeHg fluxes were available. Upper soil THg contents were significantly correlated to throughfall inputs of Hg, i.e. lowest in the tree-less peatland and highest in the dense spruce forest. For MeHg, top layer concentrations were similar in forest soils and peatlands, likely related to atmospheric input and local production, respectively. The local peatland MeHg production was documented through significantly higher MeHg-to-THg ratios in the deeper soil layer samples. In the disturbed catchment, soils were sampled in and just outside wheeltracks in an area impacted by forest machinery. Here, MeHg concentrations and the MeHg-to-THg ratios in the upper 5 cm were weakly significantly (p = 0.07) and significantly (p = 0.04) different in and outside of the wheeltracks, respectively, suggesting that soil disturbance promotes methylation. Differences in catchment Hg and MeHg streamwater concentrations were not explained by soil Hg and MeHg information, perhaps because hydrological pathways are a stronger determinant of streamwater chemistry than small variations in soil chemistry driven by disturbance and atmospheric inputs of Hg.","2016-11","2025-01-08 20:46:22","2025-03-12 01:42:02","","140-149","","","218","","Environ.

Two water table treatments were applied: one with constant water tables at 5 cm below the moss surface, and one in which the water table was allowed to drop, resulting in water tables fluctuating between 5 and 21 cm below the moss surface.

Furthermore, Sphagnum cuspidatum production decreased with fluctuating summer water tables, while Sphagnum magellanicum responded oppositely. From these results we conclude that increased occurrence of periods with low water tables may bring about a shift in dominant Sphagnum species as well as a shift from graminoid to ericoid vascular plant cover, resembling the shift from hollow to lawn or hummock vegetation.

The floristic patterns and their relationships to methane (CH4) emission, hydrology and water chemistry were analysed with classification (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). 2 Despite differences in vegetation physiognomy, chemistry, and geology, water chemistry (pH, Ca, Mg, K-corr) and hydrology explain most of the species distribution in both peatland regions. In the Clay Belt, bryophytes respond primarily to water table position, and secondarily to water chemistry; the reverse is true for the vascular flora. The bryophyte and vascular ordinations are more similar to each other in the Labrador Trough than in boreal sites. 3 Although CH4 emissions are lower in subarctic than in boreal sites, mean CH4 flux is strongly correlated with mean water table position (r(2) = 0.73) in both regions, but is not correlated with water chemistry. The highest CH4 emissions (seasonal mean greater than or equal to 100 mg m(-2) day(-1)) occur in raised bog and patterned poor fen pools where the peat mat is degrading. 4 The relationships among CH4 flux, mean water table position, and species distribution are similar in both boreal and subarctic regions. Bryophytes are generally better predictors of CH4 flux than vascular plants, except for certain species in flooded sites (e.g. Carex spp.). Bryophytes are also better indicators of the long-term average position of the water table, reflecting relative zones of methane production and oxidation over the season. In the vascular plant analyses, shrub cover indicates dry conditions and low CH4 flux in the sharply differentiated string-flark-pool topography of the subarctic fens, but is less predictive of CH4 emission in the drier hummock-hollow microtopography at boreal sites where shrubs and trees are more pervasive. Overall herbaceous or sedge cover is not indicative of CH4 flux in either region.","1995-06","2025-01-08 20:46:23","2025-10-02 13:50:27","","403-420","","3","83","","J.

The bog is located in the zone with the highest atmospheric nitrogen deposition for Canada, estimated at 0.8-1.2 g N m-2 yr-1 (wet deposition as NH4 and NO3). To establish the effect of nutrient addition on this ecosystem, we fertilized the bog with six treatments involving the application of 1.6-6 g N m-2yr-1 (as NH4 NO3), with and without P and K, in triplicate 3m 3m plots. The initial 5-6 years have shown a loss of first Sphagnum, then Polytrichum mosses, and an increase in vascular plant biomass and leaf area index. Analyses of NEE, measured in situ with climate-controlled chambers, indicate that contrary to expectations, the treatments with the highest levels of nutrient addition showed lower rates of maximum NEE and gross photosynthesis, but little change in ecosystem respiration after 5 years. Although shrub biomass and leaf area increased in the high nutrient plots, loss of moss photosynthesis owing to nutrient toxicity, increased vascular plant shading and greater litter accumulation contributed to the lower levels of CO2 uptake.

Long-term apparent rates of carbon accumulation ranged between 8.1 and 36.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (average = 18.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The highest carbon accumulation estimates were recorded prior to 5400 cal yr BP when a fen existed at this site, however following the fen-to-bog transition carbon accumulation stabilized. Carbon accumulation remained relatively constant through the Neoglacial period after 2400 cal yr BP when pollen-based paleoclimate reconstructions from a nearby lake (McAndrews et al., 1982) and reconstructions of the depth to the water table derived from testate amoeba data suggest a wetter climate.

The reactive mineral phases of these dust particles can potentially dissolve in acidic (pH < 4) bog waters. Their dissolution could release trace elements (TEs), which could eventually alter these bog ecosystems. The impact of dust dissolution on the abundance of TEs in the dissolved (<0.45 μm) fraction of porewaters from excavated pits (30–40 cm deep) in the ombrogenic zone of five peatlands was evaluated. Porewaters were collected from four bogs situated within 70 km of mines and upgraders in the Athabasca Bituminous Sands (ABS) region, Alberta, Canada, and from a reference bog situated 264 km away. Over two consecutive years, the dissolved concentrations of some conservative (Al, Th, Y) and mobile lithophile elements (Fe, Li, Mn, Sr), as well as the metals enriched in bitumen (V, Ni, Mo), all increased with proximity to the mining area, in the ABS region. These trends reflect the observed increase in dust deposition with proximity to the mining area from independent studies of snow, lichens, and Sphagnum moss. Contrarily, the impact of dust dissolution on the concentration of potentially toxic TEs (As, Cd, Pb, Sb, and Tl) was negligible. Thus, the elements which are more abundant in the porewaters near industry are either ecologically benign (e.g. Li and Sr) or essential micronutrients (e.g. Fe, Mn, Ni, and Mo). Manganese was the only element which was enriched by more than 10x at all sites near the mining area, compared to its concentration at the reference site. The enrichments of all other elements were <10x, indicating that anthropogenic dust emissions from mining areas have had only a modest effect on the TEs abundance in peat porewaters.","2024-03-15","2025-01-08 20:46:23","2025-03-07 18:21:45","","123470","","","345","","Environ.

No differences in surface elevation and hummock-hollow microtopography were detected between road clearances and adjacent peatlands, but clearances had significantly thinner active layer, which persisted at least 7 years after abandonment. The cover of lichens, bryophytes, and vascular plants returned within 5 years to similar levels as in undisturbed peatlands, although species richness per quadrat remained lower and species composition differed. The limited recovery of black spruce on these peatlands and their slow growth indicates that the full recovery of vegetation structure on these road clearances will take decades.

A three-year field experiment was conducted to test a modification of existing peatland rehabilitation protocols on winter road clearances in subarctic peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowland. The experiment was conducted on severely disturbed sections of winter roads with extensive cut hummocks. Sphagnum fragments were not spread on bare peat surfaces, contrary to existing protocols, because of the close proximity to propagules in vast and adjacent, undisturbed peatlands. Factorial combinations of microclimate amelioration (straw mulch) and phosphorus fertilization were applied, as in existing protocols. Rock phosphate fertilization and straw mulch did not increase the recolonization of <i>Sphagnum </i>nor of other bryophytes, lichens or vascular plants. After three years, Sphagnum remained almost absent and bare peat was colonized mostly by lichens and bryophytes typical of disturbed peat surfaces. The spreading of fragments on top of severely disturbed surface peats appears to be required in order to rehabilitate peatlands, even when extensive undisturbed peatlands are found nearby.","2014","2025-01-08 20:46:23","2025-03-14 19:01:08","","153-159","","2","32","","Ecol.

Wind erosion has been suspected to play a role in this instability. Four studies were conducted to investigate the role of wind erosion on abandoned milled peatlands. A wind tunnel experiment was performed to evaluate the erodibility of dry, loose peat as a function of its degree of decomposition. A second wind tunnel experiment was conducted to determine how crusted peats differ in their resistance to erosion as a function of their degree of decomposition, without the input of abraders. Third, wind profiles were measured in milled, revegetated and natural peatlands in southeastern Québec to determine their aerodynamic roughness length. Finally, field measurements were made at three abandoned milled peatlands through two field seasons to characterize substrate stability and particle movement. In the wind tunnel, the erodibility of loose surface peat decreased with increasing decomposition and was predicted by their equivalent diameter to mineral particles 0.84 mm in diameter. However, once surface crusts formed, peats were all resistant to erosion. Surfaces of abandoned milled peatlands were aerodynamically smooth; therefore, exposed surface elements are subject to strong erosive forces during wind events. The greatest subsidence on abandoned milled peatlands occurred in the spring, prior to the surface movement of particles. Erosion during the summer could not be clearly detected. The instability of the peat surface remains a constraint for the restoration of abandoned milled surfaces.","2002","2025-01-08 20:46:23","2025-03-07 18:21:17","","85-95","","1","82","","Can. J.

One approach is to use fragments of Sphagnum collected from a natural area as diaspores. Only the surface layer (0-10 cm) of a peat profile contained enough viable material to be of practical use as a source of diaspores. Small (0.5-cm), medium (1-cm) or large (2-cm) diaspores had similar recolonization success, so obtaining a precise, even size of fragments will not be an important aspect to consider when scaling up to the quantities needed for restoring large surfaces. Most species reacted positively to wetter conditions, with the exception of S. fuscum. A density of 450 Sphagnum plants per m2 resulted in some Sphagnum species covering up to 50% of the peat surface in three months and 100% in six months, when the water table was close to the peat surface. Sphagnum cover reached 5-10% after three months in the drier treatments, and was generally comparable to results obtained in the field after one season of growth under shade cloth. Improving the humidity conditions offered to diaspores is the most promising approach to reduce the quantity of diaspores needed to re-establish a significant moss cover rapidly on a post-harvest surface. Selection of appropriate species and densities according to the dryness of the surface to be restored are two other elements to consider in minimizing the amount of source material needed for restoration.","1996","2025-01-08 20:46:24","2025-03-21 12:51:14","","599-608","","","33","","J.

Shrubby rich fens (SRF) in northern Alberta, Canada, are restricted to the wettest landscape positions and are characterized by brown mosses and stunted trees on weakly consolidated and saturated substrates. In situ oil sands exploration (OSE) practices have established thousands of drilling pads to explore for deeply buried bitumen deposits, with many located on peatlands. In the development of OSE pads on peatlands, the vegetation layer is removed, eliminating the functionally important hummock-hollow surface topography. We examined the spontaneous regeneration of bryophytes and vascular plants and surface microtopography on SRF, 7 and again 14 years after pad abandonment. In both sampling years, drilling pad surfaces were closer to the water table (mean pad elevation 2012 = 3.3 cm, 2019 = 5.6 cm) and had minor topography compared to adjacent reference habitat. We found, however, over the 7 years, that for both drilling pads and reference habitat, bryophyte and vascular plant richness decreased, and most species declined in frequency. Furthermore, for pads and reference habitat, density of tree seedlings decreased, and expansion of hummock-forming mosses was limited. Findings suggest that drilling pads and their natural counterparts on SRF may be prone to episodic reductions in plant diversity and ecosystem retrogression, likely resulting from prolonged surface saturation during summers with high rainfall. Because of their wet landscape positions and environmental vulnerability, SRF are likely the peatland habitats slowest to recover following OSE pad construction.","2024-07","2025-01-08 20:46:24","2025-03-07 22:07:53","","","","5","32","","Restor.

In situ oil sands extraction requires exploration of oil resources on a dense network of drilling pads across the landscape. This study examined the recovery of wooded moderate-rich (WMR) fens 10 years after abandonment of these sites with minimal restorative measures. Bryophyte and vascular plant diversity, site microtopography, and water chemistry were assessed on drilling pads and in adjacent areas of undisturbed reference habitat. WMR fens affected by drilling activities were divided a priori into two groups based on strongly divergent trends in their successional development. One group represented the majority of WMR fens observed on the land base; at these sites hummock-forming mosses including minerotrophic Sphagnum species were infrequent and tree recruitment was almost absent. The other group was dominated by Sphagnum species, had Picea mariana and Larix laricina recruitment, and appeared to recover more quickly. Both groups had high abundance of wetland sedges, notably Carex aquatilis. Further, drilling pads belonging to the first group had a high water table, limited elevated microsites, and had surface flooding over a portion of the growing season, in contrast to Sphagnum-dominated sites. Development of the aquatic, bryophyte-poor wetland type is comparable to early stages of wetland succession and these systems will recover relatively slowly, likely from decades to more than a century. Restoring part of the vertical distribution of micro-habitats before abandonment of these pads could stimulate the successional recovery of vegetation.","2014-09","2025-01-08 20:46:24","2025-03-07 22:07:54","","657-667","","5","22","","Restor.

Objectives: We assessed the utility of multiple, fine-grained remote sensing datasets for mapping peatland features and associated degraded areas at a landscape-scale. Specifically, we developed an integrated approach to identify and quantify multiple types of peatland degradation including: anthropogenic drainage ditches and peat cuttings; erosional gullies and bare peat areas. Methods: Airborne LiDAR, CASI and aerial image datasets of the South West UK, were combined to identify features within Dartmoor National Park peatland area that contribute to degradation. These features were digitised and quantified using ArcGIS before appropriate buffers were applied to estimate the wider ecohydrologically affected area. Results: Using fine-scale, large-extent remotely sensed data, combined with aerial imagery enabled key features within the wider expanse of peatland to be successfully identified and mapped at a resolution appropriate to future targeted restoration. Combining multiple datasets increased our understanding of spatial distribution and connectivity within the landscape. An area of 29km<sup>2</sup> or 9.2% of the Dartmoor peatland area was identified as significantly and directly ecohydrologically degraded. Conclusions: Using a combination of fine-grained remotely sensed datasets has advantages over traditional ground survey methods for identification and mapping of anthropogenic and natural erosion features at a landscape scale. The method is accurate, robust and cost-effective particularly given the remote locations and large extent of these landscapes, facilitating effective and targeted restoration planning, management and monitoring.","2019-06","2025-01-08 20:46:24","2025-03-12 18:13:35","","1329-1345","","6","34","","Landscape Ecol.","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.2","2","SC: 0000042","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of multiple remote sensing tools to follow the degradation of blanket peatlands in the UK, with the aim to facilitate future restoration planning.

Although soil activity in northern peatlands can be limited by low pH, low temperatures, high C:N and C:P ratios of soil organic matter, and/or anaerobic conditions, different classes of peatlands (bog and fen) vary in the type and degree of stress affecting soil processes. We employed in situ studies, laboratory incubations, and a fertilization and liming experiment to understand peatland mineralization dynamics further. Nitrogen mineralization in the field was higher in the fen than in the bog, but net P mineralization was close to zero in both sites. Soil cores were removed from plots that had been treated for 2 years with NH(4)(+), PO(4)(-2), and/or CaCO(3), followed by a 30-week lab incubation. Nutrient additions in the bog increased the labile N pool (NO), and cumulative N and P mineralization over 30 weeks, but lime addition had no effect. Nutrient additions to the fen did not significantly alter nutrient pool sizes (N(0), P(0)), cumulative mineralization totals, or mineralization rates. However, lime additions decreased potentially mineralizable N and cumulative N mineralization in the fen aerobic incubations, but increased cumulative P mineralization in the anaerobic incubations. Although both are peatlands, bog and fen nutrient cycles are controlled by different factors that may explain the differences in mineralization, total soil N and P, and respective labile pools. This information may be especially useful in anticipating changes brought about by anthropogenic nutrient/cation inputs and hydrologic alterations.","2003-06","2025-01-08 20:46:24","2025-03-07 22:07:08","","409-420","","6","168","","Soil Sci.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","4","","<p>- This paper examines the effect of nutrient and lime addition to peatlands and their biogeochemistry.</p>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; bog; decomposition; peat; nutrients; carbon cycle; nutrient enrichment; fen; substrate; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesize that relatively low-impact disturbances such as seismic lines will increase the fragmentation of wetlands, resulting in shrub growth. Bi-temporal lidar data collected circa 2008 and 2018 were used to identify correspondence between the density of anthropogenic disturbances, wetland shape complexity and changes in vegetation height within >1800 wetlands near Fort McKay, Alberta, Canada. We found that up to 50% of wetlands were disturbed by anthropogenic disturbance in some parts of the region, with the highest proportional disturbance occurring within fens. Areas of dense anthropogenic disturbance in bogs resulted in increased growth and expansion of shrubs, while we found the opposite to occur in fens and swamps during the 10-year period. Up to 30% of bogs had increased shrubification, while shrub changes in fens and swamps varied depending on density of disturbance and did not necessarily correspond with shrub growth. As wetland shapes became increasingly elongated, the prevalence of shrubs declined between the two time periods, which may be associated with hydrological drivers (e.g. elongated may indicate surface and ground-water discharge influences). The results of this study indicate that linear disturbances such as seismic lines, considered to have relatively minimal impacts on ecosystems, can impact proximal wetland shape, fragmentation and vegetation community changes, especially in bogs.","2021-08-01","2025-01-08 20:46:24","2025-03-12 18:13:47","","146638","","","780","","Sci.

Here, TEs in Sphagnum moss and acid soluble ash (ASA, obtained by leaching ash for 15 min using 2% HNO3) are used to estimate the distribution of TEs between these two aerosol fractions. Total concentrations of all elements increase toward industry, but chemical reactivity of the ash varies. Most of the Al is acid soluble, but most of the Th is not; the former is assumed to reflect the abundance and reactivity of light minerals, and the latter is a surrogate for heavy minerals. In the ASA, the trends in Ni and V, the dominant metals in bitumen, resemble Al. In contrast, Mo (also enriched in bitumen), plus Pb, Sb and Tl, are more like Th in exhibiting limited reactivity. Trace element enrichments in both the total and ASA fractions, relative to crustal abundance, are restricted to plant micronutrients (e.g., Cu, Mn, Mo, Zn), or elements that are passively taken up by plants (e.g., Cd and Rb, but apparently also Ag and Re). The greatest enrichments of TEs occur at the reference site, even though it is located 264 km from the centre of industrial activities. The ash of moss collected nearest industry is dominated by quartz (67%) which explains the low concentrations of TEs, absence of enrichment relative to crustal abundance, and limited chemical reactivity of Pb, Sb and Tl. In this region, total concentrations of TEs in moss are a poor guide to their bioaccessibility in the environment.","2024","2025-01-08 20:46:25","2025-02-10 13:42:10","","408-424","","3","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>- This paper exaines the bioavailability of elements in aerosols collected from sphagnum near mining operations (AB oil sands).</p>","","","Canada; peatland; mine footprint; mining; bog; monitoring; pollution; air pollution; bryophytes; sphagnum; fugitive dust; metal/metalloid; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent advances in peatland restoration in NA have expanded the original concepts and methodology. Restoration efforts in NA now include restoring peatlands from many diverse types of disturbances (e.g. roads, agriculture, grazing, erosion, forestry, and petrol industry infrastructure impacts) and occur in a greater array of peatland types (e.g. fens and swamps). Because fens are groundwater and surface flow driven, techniques to restore the hydrology of fens are generally more complicated than bogs. Restoring a greater variety of peatland types on a large-scale basis (>10 ha) commands new techniques for reestablishing a broader array of plants other than Sphagnum spp., including non-Sphagnum mosses, sedges, nonericaceous shrubs, and trees. The rationale for restoring peatlands has expanded to include legal requirements, wetland mitigation and banking, climate mitigation, water quality, and as part of responsible ecosystem management for industry or society. In the past 25 years, peatland restoration in NA has evolved from (1) trial and error to a more empirically based scientific approach, (2) small site-specific experiments to landscape-scale restoration (e.g. hydrological connectivity, ecological fragmentation), and (3) individual stakeholder (academic) to multiple stakeholders across jurisdictional boundaries (private, local, and regional governmental agencies, NGOs, and so on). However, many research gaps still exist that must be addressed to enhance our ability to restore peatlands successfully.","2017","2025-01-08 20:46:25","2025-10-02 13:51:00","","283-292","","2","25","","Restor.

Peat soil tested in this study was collected from the peatland in the north-eastern Poland, 250 km north-east of Warsaw. Peat samples were taken from eight different depths below the ground surface over an area of approximately 2500 m2. The research programme consisted of laboratory tests of the physical properties of peat and compressibility tests conducted in oedometers.  Tests were performed in accordance with the current international and European standards using specialised research equipment. Based on the degree of decomposition, peat was divided into fibric (with more than 66% of fibres), hemic (fibre content from 33% to 66%) and sapric (less than 33% of plant fibres). The bulk and particle densities, natural water content, organic content, initial void ratio and the degree of decomposition were investigated as the physical properties of peat. Based on the oedometer tests, the constrained modulus, compression and secondary compression indexes were determined. It was concluded that the fibric peat is characterised by the lowest bulk and particle densities, the highest water and organic contents, void ratio and compressibility in comparison to hemic and sapric peat. The characteristics of peat have been related to the results presented in the literature.","2023","2025-01-08 20:46:25","2025-03-07 18:21:40","","133-143","","2","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0.6","","SC: None[s0]","<p>- This paper examines the effect of fibre content in peat on its geotechnical characteristics, including its compressibility. </p>","","","peatland; linear disturbance; peat; substrate disturbance; roads; compaction; geotechnical properties; infrastructure; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, changes in water availability associated with climate control peatland vegetation and carbon uptake processes. We examined the influence of changing hydrology on plant species abundance and ecosystem primary production in an Alaskan fen by manipulating the water table in field treatments to mimic either sustained flooding (raised water table) or drought (lowered water table) conditions for 6 years. We found that water table treatments altered plant species abundance by increasing sedge and grass cover in the raised water table treatment and reducing moss cover while increasing vascular green area in the lowered water table treatment. Gross primary productivity was lower in the lowered treatment than in the other plots, although there were no differences in total biomass or vascular net primary productivity among the treatments. Overall, our results indicate that vegetation abundance was more sensitive to variation in water table than total biomass and vascular biomass accrual. Finally, in our experimental peatland, drought had stronger consequences for change in vegetation abundance and ecosystem function than sustained flooding.","2015-02","2025-01-08 20:46:25","2025-03-07 18:06:19","","185-193","","2","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.2","3","SC: 0000060","<p>- This paper examines the effects of drought and flooding on the carbon dynamics and vegetation of a fen in Alaska. </p>","","","peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; flooding; drawdown; carbon cycle; primary productivity; fen; graminoids; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research investigates the geochemical effects of tailings dust on surface waters near Stirling mine, Nova Scotia. Tailings were sieved to <63 μm as a proxy for dust and analyzed geochemically and mineralogically for the identification of primary and secondary metal-bearing phases using a scanning electron microscope with automated mineralogy, electron microprobe analysis and synchrotron-based microanalysis. Metal-hosting phases identified include in order of abundance; sphalerite (ZnS), cerussite (PbCO3), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), Pb–Mn phases (possibly cesàrolite (PbMn3O6(OH)2)), smithsonite (ZnCO3), goethite (FeO(OH), aurichalcite ((Zn,Cu)5(CO3)2(OH)6), hydrohetaerolite (ZnMn2O4·H2O), tennantite (Cu6(Cu4Zn2)As4S12S), and galena (PbS). Shake flask tests were conducted in simulated stream waters (pH = 7) using sieved tailings and passive dry deposition collector filters to investigate the solubility of metal-hosting mineral phases within dust. Results indicate metal leaching at near neutral pH conditions. Sphalerite, cerussite and chalcopyrite are likely the main sources of Zn, Pb, and Cu in the shake flask leachate, based on calculated saturated indices and mass balance. Analyses of stream waters indicate similar conditions (pH, ORP, saturation indices, etc.) compared to the results of the shake flask tests, suggesting they provide reasonable insight about processes occurring in the field. Tailings dust generated at the site is therefore a potential source of metals to surface waters.","2021-05-01","2025-01-08 20:46:25","2025-03-07 21:59:19","","104927","","","128","","Appl.

We conducted two field experiments to examine how they could be applied to subarctic peatlands, disturbed by mining in the Hudson Bay Lowland, Canada. In a first experiment we tested microclimatic amelioration techniques including two local mulches, two commercial mulches and two densities of Eriophorum vaginatum as companion plants against controls. In a second factorial experiment, we tested whether Sphagnum could be spread during the winter onto frozen ground or snow, thereby allowing the mechanization of these techniques. The first experiment demonstrated that the spreading of Sphagnum fragments re-establishes a Sphagnum cover after 3 years, comparable to restored milled peatlands in southeastern Canada. However, no mulch was required, contrary to existing protocols. In the winter spreading experiment, Sphagnum capitula survived and showed similar densities during the first year as in the first experiment, but cover was substantially lower in the third year. A straw mulch helped establishment in the first year, but by the third season, control plots were no different from mulched plots. This study demonstrates that peatland restoration protocols can be extended to the Hudson Bay Lowland, and apparently simplified. Winter spreading is promising for the eventual mechanization, but further study is required to evaluate its scaling-up.","2013","2025-01-08 20:46:25","2025-03-07 18:20:11","","291-299","","2","33","","Wetlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","4","SC: 0000010","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents the results of small-scale experiments to restore linear disturbances in mining areas of the Hudson Bay Lowland.

Understanding the drivers of organic matter decomposition in constructed fens will improve our capacity to evaluate the return of ecosystem function while also helping to inform management activities that could optimize peat accumulation. At a four year old constructed fen, we measured the decomposition of <i>Carex aquatilis </i>and <i>Juncus balticus</i> tissue over one year along with soil physical and chemical properties including concentrations of phenolic compounds in pore water, and potential phenol oxidase and hydrolase enzyme activities. Results were compared to three reference fens. Averaged across both species, decomposition of aboveground plant tissue was significantly slower at the constructed fen than the reference fens. Across the reference fens, a positive relationship between phenolic compound concentrations and decomposition constant (k) suggests microbial use of phenolic compounds as substrates. We found no evidence that phenolic compounds suppressed decomposition. At the constructed fen, a negative relationship between total potential hydrolase activity and k was observed, suggesting that nutrient limitation may suppress microbial activity at the site. There was little evidence that mulch or planting treatments altered short-term litter decomposition rate at the constructed fen, indicating that future research should focus on differences in biomass production between species, below ground nutrient cycling and the longer term preservation of litter as peat to determine strategies for optimizing peat accumulation. © 2021","2021","2025-01-08 20:46:30","2025-03-08 14:24:17","","","","","776","","Sci.

Ecosystems are recognizable because of unique interactions (functions) among the components (composition) and the patterns (structure). Organized into a spatial framework, ecosystems can be defined and characterized on the basis of common features such as bedrock geology or climatic features, which set them apart from other units. Ecosystem classification delineates areas of similar ecology at different scales, often within a nested or hierarchical framework. In Ontario, Angus Hills developed the first comprehensive, multi-scale, hierarchical ELC describing ecosystems at two scales, distinguished by climatic patterns, physiographic differences and successional trends exhibited by the predominant vegetation type on those physiographic features (Hills, 1959). Subsequently, he revised the system as new information became available (see Hills, 1961, 1964, 1976) and demonstrated how the system could be used to provide a broad-scale ecological context for resource management and planning activities in Ontario. Employing the same philosophical approach and ecological principles that Hills’ used, this report provides information on the approach used to classify ecosystems at the two upper levels of the ELC hierarchy; ecozone and ecoregion, and presents a brief overview of the evolution of the provincial ELC.

Although there are numerous natural and anthropogenic activities that can increase dust and aerosol emissions and contaminant levels in the environment, mining operations are notable with respect to the quantity of particulates generated, the global extent of area impacted, and the toxicity of contaminants associated with the emissions. Here we review (i) the environmental fate and transport of metals and metalloids in dust and aerosol from mining operations, (ii) current methodologies used to assess contaminant concentrations and particulate emissions, and (iii) the potential health and environmental risks associated with airborne contaminants from mining operations. The review evaluates future research priorities based on the available literature and suggest that there is a particular need to measure and understand the generation, fate and transport of airborne particulates from mining operations, specifically the finer particle fraction. More generally, our findings suggest that mining operations play an important but underappreciated role in the generation of contaminated atmospheric dust and aerosol and the transport of metal and metalloid contaminants, and highlight the need for further research in this area. The role of mining activities in the fate and transport of environmental contaminants may become increasingly important in the coming decades, as climate change and land use are projected to intensify, both of which can substantially increase the potential for dust emissions and transport.","2012-09-01","2025-01-08 20:46:30","2025-02-08 18:42:50","","58-73","","","433","","Sci.

It is currently undergoing climatic warming alongside other anthropogenic stressors, and contains a large below-ground carbon pool. Understanding how climate variability and multiple stressors impact peat accumulation in this region is critical to discerning how northern peatlands will respond to future climate and land-use changes. Pollen- and macrofossil-based paleoecological reconstructions, and analyses of aluminum (Al) and titanium (Ti) fluxes in a Holocene-aged peat core (VM375) taken from a bog in the Attawapiskat watershed were conducted to link ecosystem changes with hydroclimate and long-term carbon storage. Peat initiation is dated to 5780 cal yr B.P., coincident with land emergence driven by glacial isostatic adjustment. From 4500 to 4200 cal yr B.P., apparent rate of carbon accumulation increased, and was linked to more rapid rates of peat accretion and increases in minerotrophic indicators in the pollen record. This increase in peat accretion and shift in vegetation composition co-occur with higher rates of mineral influx as shown by Ti and Al concentrations, which may have supplied nutrients. A fen to bog transition takes place -3300 cal yr B.P., with increases in Sphagnum spores and macrofossils, and a decline in the apparent rate of carbon accumulation relative to the earlier half of the record, where paleoecological proxies indicate treed wetland and fen stages. Since peat inception, the total carbon stock of the 260-cm peat column is 110 kg C m- 2. This multi-proxy record shows an association between changing peat types and variability in apparent rates of carbon accumulation, and supports the hypothesis that mineral nutrients either supplied by surface hydrology or by eolian deposition played a role in Holocene peat carbon accumulation in eastern North American boreal peatlands.","2022-06-15","2025-01-08 20:46:30","2025-03-07 18:21:17","","","","","596","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","2","SC: None[s0]","<p>- This paper presents the results of a paleoecological study that examined the long-term changes in carbon accumulation and mineral nutrient accumulation in a fen to bog peatland in the Hudson Bay Lowland.

Natural recovery of seismic lines to pre-disturbance treed conditions in boreal ecosystems is generally slow, and persistence of seismic lines is particularly notable in peatlands, including treed bogs. A functional trait approach can help understand the mechanisms that drive community composition and structure following a disturbance. We explored the role of environmental filters (soil moisture, soil temperature, light, and growing substrate) on vascular species composition and functional community structure on seismic lines in a treed bog near Peace River, NW Alberta. We investigated successional trajectories on seismic lines constructed between 1951 and 1986, and the impact of seismic line orientation (N-S and E-W). We also compared taxonomic and functional trait composition of plots on seismic lines, at the line edges, and in the adjacent treed bog, 75 m away from the edge. We found no differences in plant species and functional trait composition based on the seismic line age and line orientation, confirming that seismic lines are not following the expected successional trajectories frequently observed in boreal ecosystems after other disturbances such as logging or fire. Taxonomic and functional composition were different on seismic lines compared to the line edges and interior treed bog, further supporting that the lines are different from the pre-disturbance conditions. Seismic lines had a few trees, received more light, and were wetter, with an abundant deep layer of waterlogged Sphagnum, whereas the adjacent treed bog had a dense mature overstory and was drier with a higher cover of feathermoss. Seismic lines included primarily shorter species with extensive lateral expansion, which is consistent with a high abundance of low ericaceous shrubs on the lines. Dominance of ericaceous shrubs likely also played a role in low presence of herbaceous species on the lines, which is related to the low presence of hemicryptophytes, compared to the adjacent treed bog. It is unlikely that the historic seismic lines in treed bogs of Alberta will follow expected successional trajectories over the next decades without outside intervention. However, better understanding of the mechanisms that control ecosystem functioning based on taxonomic and functional community composition observed on seismic lines can inform restoration and mitigation measures needed for seismic line recovery.","2022","2025-01-08 20:46:30","2025-03-07 18:06:20","","","","","503","","For.

A major feature of the ecological footprint of oil and gas exploration is seismic lines-narrow corridors used to transport and deploy geophysical survey equipment. These lines, which traverse forests, tundra, uplands, and peatlands, were historically up to 10 m wide. Over the past decade, seismic lines have decreased in width (in some cases down to 1.75-3m); however, their density has increased drastically and their construction is expected to continue in regions of Canada and the United States that are rich in oil and gas resources. We examine the literature related to the environmental impacts of, and restoration and reclamation efforts associated with, seismic lines in the boreal and arctic ecosystems of North America. With respect to conventional seismic lines, numerous studies report significant and persistent environmental changes along these lines and slow recovery of vegetation that translates into a lasting fragmentation of the landscape. This fragmentation has many ramifications for biodiversity and ecosystem processes, including significant implications for threatened woodland caribou herds. While modern, low-impact seismic lines have comparatively lower ecological effects at the site-level, their high density and associated potential edge effects suggest that their actual environmental impact may be underestimated. Seismic line restoration is a critical aspect of future integrated landscape management in hydrocarbon-rich regions of the boreal-arctic, and if widely applied, has the potential to benefit a wide range of species and maintain or re-establish key ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity.","2018-06","2025-01-08 20:46:30","2025-03-12 01:55:17","","214-229","","2","26","","Environ.

These clearings can have a significant influence on ecosystem functioning through vegetation removal, flattening of microtopography, altering hydrological pathways, and impacting biogeochemical processes. Recently, there has been a concerted effort to restore seismic lines to bring back the localized microtopography and encourage ecosystem recovery. A common restoration approach on seismic lines is mounding, which involves using machinery to recreate natural microtopography. Research is scarce on the impact on soil properties following both these disturbances and subsequent restoration on organic soils. The objectives of this study were to: (1) identify differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between areas disturbed by seismic lines and adjacent natural areas and (2) determine changes to soil physical and chemical properties following the mounding restoration technique. Research was undertaken at two contrasting boreal ecosites (a poor mesic and a treed fen) near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. In July 2018, we collected soil samples at 34 seismic line locations, both on the line and 20 m into the adjacent undisturbed area. Samples were analyzed for bulk density, volumetric water content (VWC), organic matter (OM) content, C:N ratios, and delta C-13/delta N-15 isotope analysis. Seismic line disturbances had a significant impact on soil properties, with increased bulk density and VWC on the line at both ecosites. We found an almost 40% reduction in OM on the line compared to natural areas at the poor mesic site, implying changes to carbon cycling, increased mineralization rates, and carbon loss from the system. There was also delta C-13/delta N-15 enrichment and narrower C:N ratios on the line, indicating increased decomposition. We found evidence of increased decomposition on the mounds created after restoration at the treed fen. Our results highlight a trade-off between restoration activities that may encourage recovery but also cause increased carbon losses from the system. This research is a first step in gaining a better understanding of these impacts in light of current restoration practices to ensure best management practices for improving ecosystem functioning.","2020-07","2025-01-08 20:46:30","2025-03-07 18:20:19","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.9","3 (低预警)","SC: 0000045","<p>- This paper examines the physicochemical characteristics of sesimic lines in peatlands.

The rate of peat vertical accretion was initially low as the site transitioned from a marsh to a rich fen. These lower rates took place during the warmer temperatures of the Holocene thermal maximum, confirming the importance of hydrological controls limiting peat accretion at the local scale. Testate amoebae, pollen, and plant macrofossils indicate a transition to a poor fen and then a bog during the late Holocene, as the carbon accumulation rate and reconstructed water table depth increased.

Holocene fire frequencies are lower than in western Canadian peatlands, supporting that the HBL lies in the transition between continental and humid boreal fire regimes. Apparent carbon accumulation rates at the site were not significantly different between the Middle and Late Holocene, suggesting that higher fire frequency and enhanced decomposition offset the potential for higher rates of biomass production. We compile records from the boreal region and demonstrate that increasing fire frequency is significantly corre-lated with diminishing long-term carbon accumulation rates, despite large variation in response of peatlands to fire frequency changes.

Review of recent wildfire events have identified a need for an improved understanding of vegetation management as a means to mitigate risk of future fires in the wildland-urban and wildland-industry interfaces. Peatlands cover 21% of the land area in continental western Canada; however, there is a lack of peatland-specific fuel modification strategies. The unique ecohydrological feedbacks that operate in these ecosystems provide an opportunity to implement novel peatland-specific treatments in these areas. This thesis examines the effectiveness of novel peatland-specific fuel modification treatments derived from seismic line analogs in reducing the smouldering potential of near-surface moss and peat. An ecohydrological assessment of seismic lines bisecting bogs revealed that alterations to canopy structure and physical peat properties at the time of seismic line establishment leads to persistent changes to the ecohydrological structure and functioning of these systems, marked by limited regeneration of vegetation, dominance of <i>Sphagnum</i> groundcover, and greater near-surface volumetric water contents. Such traits are desirable in fuel modification strategies and therefore, we incorporated the seismic line framework into conventional fuel reduction approaches to create novel peatland-specific fuel modification treatments, involving alterations to canopy structure (thinning and clearing) and physical peat properties (compression). The short-term effects are compression-induced changes to hydrophysical properties including elevated mean near-surface volumetric water contents. Ecological and hydrological indicators of moss moisture stress suggest long-term effects likely include an expansion of <i>Sphagnum</i> moss ground cover within thinned and cleared areas. Ultimately, both short- and long-term effects contribute to the reduction of smouldering potential in near-surface moss and peat. We propose that these peatland-specific fuel modification treatments be incorporated into current FireSmart fuel strategies to reduce wildfire smouldering risk at the wildland-urban and wildland-industry interfaces.","2019","2025-01-08 20:46:31","2025-03-07 22:08:30","","","147","","","","","","","","","","McMaster University","Hamilton","","","M.Sc.","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis examines the reduction of smouldering fires using the ecohydrological framework of seismic lines. &nbsp;Thinning and clearing of canopy and the compression of peat are novel approaches to treat smouldering fires.</p> </div>","","","Canada; fire; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; bog; peat; substrate disturbance; groundwater; water table; impact minimization; compaction; mitigation hierarchy; smouldering; woody plants; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Novel approaches to fuel management are especially needed in peatlands where deep smouldering combustion is a challenge to suppression efforts and releases harmful emissions.

Rapid landscape alteration associated with human activity is currently challenging the evolved dynamical stability of many predator-prey systems by forcing species to behaviourally respond to novel environmental stimuli. 2. In many forested systems, linear features (LFs) such as roads, pipelines and resource exploration lines (i.e. seismic lines) are a ubiquitous form of landscape alteration that have been implicated in altering predator-prey dynamics. One hypothesized effect is that LFs facilitate predator movement into and within prey refugia, thereby increasing predator-prey spatial overlap. 3. We evaluated this hypothesis in a large mammal system, focusing on the interactions between boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) and their two main predators, wolves (Canis lupus) and black bears (Ursus americanus), during the calving season of caribou. In this system, LFs extend into and occur within peatlands (i.e. bogs and nutrient-poor fens), a habitat type highly used by caribou due to its refugia effects. 4. Using resource selection analyses, we found that LFs increased predator selection of peatlands. Female caribou appeared to respond by avoiding LFs and areas with high LF density. However, in our study area, most caribou cannot completely avoid exposure to LFs and variation in female response had demographic effects. In particular, increasing proportional use of LFs by females negatively impacted survival of their neonate calves. 5. Collectively, these results demonstrate how LFs can reduce the efficacy of prey refugia. Mitigating such effects will require limiting or restoring LFs within prey refugia, although the effectiveness of mitigation efforts will depend upon spatial scale, which in turn will be influenced by the life-history traits of predator and prey.","2018-01","2025-01-08 20:46:31","2025-03-12 01:49:51","","274-284","","1","87","","J.

In the oil sands region of Alberta, populations of culturally significant plant species overlap with extensive oil and gas development. This has led to a host of questions and concerns related to plant health and integrity from both Indigenous communities and western scientists. Here, we assessed trace element concentrations in the northern pitcher-plant (tsala’ t'ile; Sarracenia purpurea L.) with a focus on elements associated with fugitive dust and bitumen. Plant leaves were collected using clean methods and washed prior to analyses in an ultra-clean, metal-free laboratory. Pitcher-plant was an excellent model for assessing the impacts of industrial development on a culturally important, vulnerable species. Although concentrations of trace elements in pitcher-plant were low and not indicative of a toxicological concern, we saw clear dust signatures in plant tissues related to road and surface mine proximity. Elements associated with fugitive dust and bitumen extraction declined exponentially with increasing distance from a surface mine, a well-established regional pattern. However, our analyses also captured localized spikes in trace element concentrations within 300 m of unpaved roads. These local patterns are more poorly quantified at the regional scale but are indicative of the burden to Indigenous harvesters wishing to access plant populations that are not impacted by dust. Further work to directly quantify dust loads on culturally significant plants will help to define the amount of harvesting area lost to Indigenous communities due to dust impacts.","2023-10-20","2025-01-08 20:46:32","2025-03-12 01:56:39","","165142","","","896","","Sci.

These goals therefore require understanding how stressors affect the species of interest, and the food web within which the focal species is embedded. For woodland caribou, a conservation priority across much of its range, habitat loss and alteration is a primary cause of decline. Governments have identified maximum disturbance targets whereby a maximum of 35% total disturbance provides a 60% likelihood of self-sustaining caribou populations, but targets specific for linear features such as roads and seismic lines - which play a key role in altering ecological processes and are a primary focus for habitat restoration - have not been established. We created a framework to conceptually link stressors (linear features) to caribou declines via ecological mechanisms, and used this framework to guide a literature review to support the development of a linear feature-based management target for Southern Mountain Caribou. Despite the vast amount of research investigating the mechanisms leading to the negative relationship between caribou demography and linear features, our review of 54 peer-reviewed manuscripts and 99 grey-literature reports found little to no evidence of a threshold in these relationships in which to inform a linear feature-based management target for caribou population growth. Most studies evaluated how linear features modify space use of caribou, their predators, and the primary prey of those predators, whereas few mechanistically linked linear features to caribou demography. Our work provides a foundation in which other systems can conceptualize how stressors are linked to species declines, and to support the development of evidence-based management goals.","2023-10","2025-01-08 20:46:32","2025-03-12 01:49:52","","","","","154","","Ecol.

The mechanisms underlying space use can be understood by simultaneously evaluating habitat selection and movement patterns, and fine-resolution locational data are increasing our ability to do so.

Space-use response to anthropogenic linear features (LFs) by predators and prey is hypothesized to increase predator hunting efficiency and is thus believed to be a leading factor in woodland caribou declines in western Canada. We found that all species moved faster while on LFs. Wolves and bears were also attracted towards LFs, whereas prey species avoided them. Predators and prey responded less strongly and consistently to natural features such as streams, rivers and lakeshores. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that LFs facilitate predator movement and increase hunting efficiency, while prey perceive such features as risky. Understanding the behavioural mechanisms underlying space-use patterns is important in understanding how future land-use may impact predator-prey interactions. Explicitly linking behaviour to fitness and demography will be important to fully understand the implications of management strategies.","2020-02","2025-01-08 20:46:32","2025-03-12 01:49:51","","623-634","","2","89","","J.

Peatland plant community structure is predicted to change under future climate change, making the quantification of the direction and magnitude of this change a research priority. We subjected intact, replicated vegetated poor fen peat monoliths to elevated temperatures, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and two water table levels in a factorial design to determine the individual and synergistic effects of climate change factors on the poor fen plant community composition. We identify three indicators of a regime shift occurring in our experimental poor fen system under climate change: nonlinear decline of Sphagnum at temperatures 8 degrees C above ambient conditions, concomitant increases in Carex spp. at temperatures 4 degrees C above ambient conditions suggesting a weakening of Sphagnum feedbacks on peat accumulation, and increased variance of the plant community composition and pore water pH through time. A temperature increase of +4 degrees C appeared to be a threshold for increased vascular plant abundance; however the magnitude of change was species dependent. Elevated temperature combined with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> had a synergistic effect on large graminoid species abundance, with a 15 times increase as compared to control conditions. Community analyses suggested that the balance between dominant plant species was tipped from Sphagnum to a graminoid-dominated system by the combination of climate change factors.

Decomposition rates and porewater DOC concentrations significantly increased under elevated temperature conditions; however, the quality of this carbon was variable, showing signs of both increased lability and recalcitrance. Lowered water table treatments also increased decomposition rates, although the high water conditions prompted greater porewater DOC concentrations and lability.

Drainage of peatlands for agriculture results in the decomposition of organic matter, leading to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As a result, degraded peatlands are currently responsible for 2%–3% of global anthropogenic emissions. Preventing further degradation of peatlands and restoration (i.e. rewetting) are therefore important for climate change mitigation. In this study, we show that land-use change in three SSP scenarios with optimistic, recent trends, and pessimistic assumptions leads to peatland degradation between 2020 and 2100 ranging from −7 to +10 Mha (−23% to +32%), and a continuation or even an increase in annual GHG emissions (−0.1 to +0.4 GtCO2-eq yr−1). In default mitigation scenarios without a specific focus on peatlands, peatland degradation is reduced due to synergies with forest protection and afforestation policies. However, this still leaves large amounts of GHG emissions from degraded peatlands unabated, causing cumulative CO2 emissions from 2020 to 2100 in an SSP2-1.5 °C scenario of 73 GtCO2. In a mitigation scenario with dedicated peatland restoration policy, GHG emissions from degraded peatlands can be reduced to nearly zero without major effects on projected land-use dynamics. This underlines the opportunity of peatland protection and restoration for climate change mitigation and the need to synergistically combine different land-based mitigation measures. Peatland location and extent estimates vary widely in the literature; a sensitivity analysis implementing various spatial estimates shows that especially in tropical regions degraded peatland area and peatland emissions are highly uncertain. The required protection and mitigation efforts are geographically unequally distributed, with large concentrations of peatlands in Russia, Europe, North America and Indonesia (33% of emission reductions are located in Indonesia). This indicates an important role for only a few countries that have the opportunity to protect and restore peatlands with global benefits for climate change mitigation.","2023-06-01","2025-01-08 20:46:32","2025-02-25 14:15:35","","035002","","3","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the impact of peatland conservation and restoration as a mitigation strategy for climate change under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP).</p> </div>","","","Canada; climate change; peatland; on-site restoration; greenhouse gases; carbon cycle; impact avoidance; impact minimization; mitigation hierarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vast majority of produced Cr is used during the production of stainless steel, which owes its corrosion resistance mainly to the presence of Cr. In turn, stainless steel is mainly produced from Cr-containing scrap metal and FeCr, which is a relatively crude alloy between iron (Fe) and Cr. The production of FeCr is an energy and material-intensive process, and a relatively wide variety of by-products, typically classified as waste materials by the FeCr industry, are created during FeCr production. The type and extent of waste generation are dictated by the smelting route used and the management practices thereof employed by a specific smelter. In some cases, waste management of hazardous and non-hazardous materials may be classified as insufficient. Hazardous materials, such as hexavalent Cr, i.e., Cr(VI), -containing wastes, are only partially mitigated. Additionally, energy-containing wastes, such as carbon monoxide (CO)-rich off-gas, are typically discarded, and energy-invested materials, such as fine oxidative sintered chromite, are either stockpiled or sold as ordinary chromite. In cases where low-value containing wastes are generated, such as rejects from ore beneficiation processes, consistent and efficient processes are either difficult to employ or the return on investment of such processes is not economically viable. More so, the development of less carbon (C)-intensive (e.g., partial replacement of C reductants) and low-temperature pellet curing processes are currently not considered by the South African FeCr smelting industry. The reasoning for this is mainly due to increased operation costs (if improved waste management were to be implemented/higher cost reductants were used) and a lack of research initiatives. These reasons result in the stagnation of technologies. From an environmental point of view, smelting industries are pressured to reduce C emissions. An attractive approach for removing oxygen from the target metal oxides, and the mitigation of gaseous C, is by using hydrogen as a reductant. By doing so, water vapor is the only by-product. It is however expected that stable metal oxides, such as the Cr-oxide present in chromite, will be significantly more resistive to gaseous hydrogen-based reduction when compared to Fe-oxides. In this review, the various processes currently used by the South African FeCr industry are summarized in detail, and the waste materials per process step are identified. The limitations of current waste management regimes and possible alternative routes are discussed where applicable. Various management regimes are identified that could be improved, i.e., by utilizing the energy associated with CO-rich off-gas combustion, employing a low-temperature alternative chromite pelletization process, and considering the potential of hydrogen as a chromite reductant. These identified regimes are discussed in further detail, and alterative processes/approaches to waste management are proposed.","2023-06","2025-01-08 20:46:32","2025-03-12 01:43:33","","","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.5","3","SC: 0000018","<p>- This paper presents chemical processes to treat Cr(VI) from waste materials from ferrochrome mining and processing.

The vegetation communities within and adjacent to power line ROWs were sampled in 23 bogs and 11 fens in southern Québec. In fens, invasive species were found in abundance along the first 250 m within ROWs, while native non-peatland species were able to spread into entire ROWs. Invasive species were also able to colonize the adjacent fen habitats but were mostly concentrated in the first 4 m from ROW edges. Some species were, however, able to establish at more than 43 m from ROWs. Invasive and native non-peatland species were mostly restricted to the first 31 m within ROWs intersecting a bog and almost none dispersed in the adjacent bog habitats. Overall, the average cover of native non-peatland and invasive species in ROWs was mostly related to intrinsic abiotic conditions such as water pH, water conductivity, and water table level, while landscape surrounding the peatland and historical variables (e.g., time elapse since the construction of the ROW) had few impacts in both bogs and fens.","2011","2025-01-08 20:46:33","2025-03-07 21:59:21","","91-103","","2","89","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1.1","4","","<p>- This paper demonstrates that non-native species non-peatland colonize linear disturbances in peatlands.</p>","","","Canada; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; transmission lines; bog; fen; invasive species; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mapping and thermal modeling of frozen peat plateau stability indicate that permafrost peatlands are stable at a mean annual air temperature as warm as -3.5C. In the peat plateaus of the northern lowland, permafrost can be absent at the peat plateau margins where peat plateaus border fens or lakes. Here, insulating snow accumulations permit thawed conditions at mean annual air temperatures colder than -3.5C. Continued warming will result in expansion of thawed zones, subsidence at plateau margins, and even collapse of plateau surfaces, resulting in conversion to fen. This process has already occurred across north-central Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta since the end of the Little Ice Age, and there are signs that it is extending into the northern Hudson Bay lowland.

Sulfur bridges provide efficient binding of As to organic carbon (C), but the formation of aqueous As–S species, so-called thioarsenates, leads to a low to no sorption tendency to organic C functional groups. Here, we studied how pH changes the role of reduced S in desorption and retention of presorbed As in model peat. Control desorption experiments without S addition revealed that As was mobilized, predominantly as arsenite, in all treatments with relative mobilization increasing with pH (4.5 < 7.0 < 8.5). Addition of sulfide or polysulfide caused substantial As retention at acidic conditions but significantly enhanced As desorption compared to controls at neutral to alkaline pH. Thioarsenates dominated As speciation at pH 7.0 and 8.5 (maximum, 79%) and remained in solution without (re)sorption to peat. Predominance of arsenite in control experiments and no evidence of surface-bound thioarsenates at pH 7.0 suggest mobilization to proceed via arsenite desorption, reaction with dissolved or surface-bound reduced S, and formation of thioarsenates. Our results suggest that natural or management-related increases in pH or increases in reduced S in near-neutral pH environments can turn organic matter from an As sink into a source.","2020-06-02","2025-01-08 20:46:33","2025-02-08 18:42:56","","6682-6692","","11","54","","Environ.

However, contaminant re-mobilization may occur related to management changes or chemical alteration of original peatland conditions. For a treatment peatland in Finnish Lapland, we here confirm efficient As retention in near-surface peat layers close to the mining waste water inflow, likely due to binding to FeIII-phases. Seven years into operation of the treatment peatland, there appears to be further retention potential, as large areas downstream still had solid-phase As concentrations at background levels. However, via depth-resolved pore water analysis we observed a hotspot 170 m from the inflow at 10–50 cm depth, where As pore water concentrations exceeded input concentrations by a factor of 20, indicating substantial As re-mobilization. At the same spot, a peak of reduced sulfur (S) species was found. Arsenic species detected were arsenite and up to 26% methylated oxyarsenates, 15% methylated and 7.9% inorganic thioarsenates. We postulate that As mobilization is a result of short-term re-equilibration to a changed inflow chemistry after installation of a process water treatment plant and a long-term consequence of changing pore water pH from acidic to near-neutral, releasing reduced S and As. We infer that the co-occurrence of reduced S and As leads to formation of methylated and/or thiolated As species with known low sorption affinity, thereby further enhancing As mobility. Laboratory incubation studies with two peat cores confirmed a high S-induced As mobilization potential, especially when As-Fe-rich, oxic surface layers were incubated anoxically at near-neutral pH. Highest risk of As re-mobilization from this treatment peatland is expected in a scenario in which mining waste water inflow has stopped but the peatland remains flooded, and near-surface layers transition from oxic to anoxic conditions.","2021","2025-01-08 20:46:33","2025-03-12 01:43:32","","","","","758","","Sci.

Despite the potential for widespread changes in water availability to occur, information about hydrological and ecological feedbacks in the HBL remains limited. This study, located near the De Beers Victor diamond mine similar to 90 km west of Attawapiskat (Ontario, Canada), investigates the influence of mine dewatering activities ('pumping') and climatic variability on the radial growth of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) trees. Tree stem disks were collected from stunted black spruce trees in one reference (n=25) and three mine-affected bogs within the area of dewatering influence (n=41) along a transect of variable underlying aquitard (marine sediment) thickness. Pumping was not found to have influenced annual ring-width indices (RWIs) in mine-affected areas with either thick (6 to >18 m) or thin (< 5m) underlying marine sediment, as these sites showed similar growth patterns to the reference site during the period of mine operation. Analyses of the influence of climate on tree radial growth (1970-2018) using 20-year moving windows showed significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations (Pearson R) between residual RWI and mean monthly air temperature, including June (1979-2007 excluding the window of 1986-2006), August (1989-2018) and September (1984-2009). In addition, for the period during which ground temperature data were available (2011-2018), significant negative correlations were detected between residual RWI and mean monthly soil temperatures in late winter and early spring. The above relationships highlight the importance of both growing and shoulder season conditions for tree growth. As the HBL continues to respond to climate change, the growth response and potential proliferation of black spruce will undoubtedly influence the water balance and hydrological function of bog peatlands in the region.","2024","2025-01-08 20:46:34","2025-03-12 01:56:41","","","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1.2","4","SC: 0000000","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper uses dendrochronology of black spruce to examine the changes in water table brought about by mine dewatering and climate change in the Hudson Bay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; climate change; hydrology; peatland; vegetation; mining; vascular plants; water table; drawdown; monitoring; biomonitoring; dendrochronology; Hudson Bay Lowland; woody plants; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we explore the hydrochemical response of a disturbed fen (Firebag Fen) in the AOSR following the removal of a temporary access road that was operational from 2007 to 2013. Prior to road removal flow was impeded at Firebag Fen, evidenced by inundation on the up-gradient side, and a lower water table on the down-gradient side of the road. Reclamation included the road removal of the ~0.5 m thick road, including 0.15 m of clay, 0.3 m of mud and organics, and 0.05 m of gravel, which left a surficial depression following removal. Peat samples (n = 139) collected immediately following road removal demonstrated significantly greater bulk densities on the down-gradient side relative to the up-gradient side of the fen, and in the road-removed area relative to up- and down-gradient areas. These combined changes decreased the average hydraulic conductivity of the fen by ~79%, which reduced water discharge across the site. Another peat sampling campaign in 2016 (n = 48), three years after removal, showed a significant decrease in bulk density where the road was removed, to within the range of values observed at areas up and down-gradient of the road. These changes increased the average hydraulic conductivity of the entire system by 64%, compared to that which was measured in 2013, with water discharge 9 and 12% higher than in 2013, during characteristically dry and wet periods, respectively. Some changes to the water chemistry (n = 24–28 for each sampling date) of the fen were also detected but patterns were different among parameters measured. For example, median concentrations on the down-gradient side of the road were 1651% (NO3–), 280% (SO42−) and 135% (Cl−) higher relative to the up-gradient side of the road. Over time following road removal, differences were reduced to 100% for nitrate, 192% for sulphate, 108% for chloride, while other parameters remained relatively unchanged (Ca2+, Mg2+, K−). Continued peat rebound (thus increasing hydraulic conductivity) may occur over time; however, elucidating this would require long-term monitoring. It is concluded that despite the impacts that were caused to the site, the natural hydrologic regime of the fen was able to operate following removal. Removal and reclamation should be considered as a worthwhile venture for roads that extend through fens and are no longer in use.","2021","2025-01-08 20:46:34","2025-03-12 01:48:50","","","","","594","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6.4","1","SC: 0000010","<p>- This paper examines the effect of road removal on the hydrological and nutrient characteristics of the restored peat substrate in a fen in the Alberta bitumen sands region.

Characterizing organic soils based on their simple index properties is useful for the preliminary design stages of construction projects. There are three main index properties used for assessing organic soils properties, namely: the water content, the organic content, and the fiber content. Organic soils are distinguished by their relatively high water content. The organic content includes the carbonaceous and combustible components. Whereas the fiber content accounts for the presence of fibers in organic soils based on their botanical composition and the degree of decomposition. The data available in literature regarding organic soils parameters (index, compressibility and shear strength) were collected and analyzed in this study to obtain new correlations between the different organic soil parameters, and the simple index parameters (water content and organic content). The available correlations found in the literature depend on relating a certain parameter with either the organic content or water content. However, the organic content and the water content are related. Hence, the proposed correlations presented in this study aim to connect the particular soil parameter with both the water content and the organic content, using the same equation. Unfortunately, there is not much data in the literature about the soil texture or fiber content, and their relation with other parameters. Hence, all the proposed correlations in this study are not considering the fibre content or the soil fabric.","2021-06-01","2025-01-08 20:46:34","2025-03-07 18:21:41","","3315-3336","","5","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1.7","","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>-This paper reviews the geotechnical properties of peat for construction in Canada.

The goal of this study is to determine whether the wildland fires that burn across seismic lines in peatlands result in the regeneration of woody vegetation within the ecotonal areas adjacent to seismic lines. We use a combination of seismic line and vegetation structural characteristics derived from multi-spectral airborne lidar across a post-fire peatland chronosequence. We found an increasing encroachment of shrubs and trees into seismic lines after many years since a fire, especially in fens, relative to unburned peatlands. Fens typically had shorter woody vegetation regeneration (average = 3.3 m ± 0.9 m, standard deviation) adjacent to seismic lines compared to bogs (average = 3.8 m ± 1.0 m, standard deviation), despite enhanced shrubification closer to seismic lines. The incoming solar radiation and seismic line age since the establishment of seismic line(s) were the factors most strongly correlated with enhanced shrubification, suggesting that the increased light and time since a disturbance are driving these vegetation changes. Shrub encroachment closer to seismic lines tends to occur within fens, indicating that these may be more sensitive to drying conditions and vegetation regeneration after several years post-fire/post-seismic line disturbance. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2025-01-08 20:46:34","2025-09-09 20:48:09","","","","10","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.9","2","SC: 0000002","<p>- This paper presents the impacts of fire on seismic line revegetation.</p>","","","Canada; cumulative effects; fire; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; seismic lines; vegetation; remote sensing; monitoring; LiDAR; mineral exploration; vegetation disturbance; landscape conversion/fragmentation; ecotone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The creation of well-pads requires removal of vegetation and placement of mineral fill, which essentially stops any carbon (C) sequestration on the once peatland ecosystem. It is important that, once no longer in use, these well-pads are restored as long-term C (peat) accumulation is what defines peatland ecosystem. However, little is known about the recovery of greenhouse gas exchange post-restoration of these features. We studied a decommissioned well-pad located in a treed poor fen that was restored using three soil adjustment treatments (SATs): (1) complete mineral fill removal (Peat-Dec); (2) partial pad removal and burial under peat layer (BUPL); and (3) mixing mineral and peat by inversion (Mixed-P-M). The recreated peat surface was revegetated with donor peatland species using the moss layer transfer technique (MLTT). The objectives of this paper were to (1) quantify plot-scale seasonal carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange of the SATs, 2–4 years post-restoration compared to reference sites and (2) determine the influence of several environmental variables on CO2 and CH4 exchange. All SATs proved effective in recreating a soil surface needed to support peatland vegetation as shown by similar rates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Equally, both types of vegetation reintroduced led this site on a trajectory toward functioning as a net C sink.","2022","2025-01-08 20:46:34","2025-03-07 18:20:41","","e13508","","3","30","","Restor.

The focus was on the snowmelt season, with inflow and outflow sampled twice a day. All samples were analysed for stable isotopes of water and various water quality parameters. The wetland inflow and outflow were continuously monitored which in combination of precipitation and evaporation data allowed to study the effect of direct precipitation (dilution) and evaporation (enrichment) on the wetland water balance and water quality. The evaporated water volume was approximately 20% of the inflow on days with small inflows, whereas the proportion of precipitation was more variable. Negative correlations between hydraulic load and water quality at the outlet were found, whereas evaporation, precipitation from/to wetland had a negligible impact on outlet water quality. The observation year was rainier than normal, which complicated application of isotope techniques as the evaporation signal was weak. However, the heavy rain provided ample data on wetland performance under different flow conditions. The wetland reduced concentrations of e.g. suspended solids, phosphate-phosphorus, ammonium and iron, but reduction rate of other dissolved nutrients and organic carbon was low or negative. The observed retention of suspended solids load (28% during snowmelt, 61% during the whole observation period) shows that treatment wetlands can reduce the environmental impact of peat extraction areas.","2015-11","2025-01-08 20:46:35","2025-03-12 01:48:33","","169-179","","","84","","Ecol.

Short-term, seasonal and long-term peat surface elevation changes are closely linked to key peatland attributes such as water table depth (WTD) and carbon balance, and may be measured remotely using satellite radar and LiDAR methods. However, field measurements of peat elevation change are spatially and temporally sparse, reliant on low-resolution manual subsidence pole measurements, or expensive sensor systems. Here we describe a novel, simple and low-cost image-based method for measuring peat surface motion and WTD using commercially available time-lapse cameras and image processing methods. Based on almost two years’ deployment of peat cameras across contrasting forested, burned, agricultural and oil palm plantation sites in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we show that the method can capture extremely high resolution (sub-mm) and high-frequency (sub-daily) changes in peat surface elevation over extended periods and under challenging environmental conditions. WTD measurements were of similar quality to commercially available pressure transducers. Results reveal dynamic peat elevation response to individual rain events, consistent with variations in WTD. Over the course of the relatively severe 2019 dry season, cameras in deep-drained peatlands recorded maximum peat shrinkage of over 8 cm, followed by partial rebound, leading to net annual subsidence of up to 5 cm. Sites with higher water tables, and where borehole irrigation was used to maintain soil moisture, had lower subsidence, suggesting potential to reduce subsidence through altered land-management. Given the established link between subsidence and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, these results have direct implications for the management of peatlands to reduce high current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Camera-based sensors provide a simple, low-cost alternative to commercial elevation, WTD and GHG flux monitoring systems, suitable for deployment at scale, and in areas where existing approaches are impractical or unaffordable. If ground-based observations of peat motion can be linked to measured GHG fluxes and with satellite-based monitoring tools, this approach offers the potential for a large-scale peatland monitoring tool, suitable for identifying areas of active carbon loss, targeting climate change mitigation interventions, and evaluating intervention outcomes.</p>","2021-03","2025-01-08 20:46:35","2025-03-12 14:31:50","","","","","9","","","Peat motion monitoring","","","","","","","English","","","","","4.6","3 (低预警)","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents a low-cost technique to measure water table change and subsidence in tropical peatlands. &nbsp;This technique should also be suitable to measure these parameters in boreal peatlands.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; peat; substrate disturbance; water table; flooding; remote sensing; drawdown; rewetting; monitoring; subsidence; camera traps; substrate; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Carbon builds up in these water-saturated environments owing to the presence of phenolic compounds-which inhibit microbial activity and therefore prevent the breakdown of organic matter. Anoxic conditions limit the activity of phenol oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of phenolic compounds. Droughts introduce oxygen into these systems, and the frequency of these events is rising. Here, we combine in vitro manipulations, mesocosm experiments and field observations to examine the impact of drought on peatland carbon loss. We show that drought stimulates bacterial growth and phenol oxidase activity, resulting in a reduction in the concentration of phenolic compounds in peat. This further stimulates microbial growth, causing the breakdown of organic matter and the release of carbon dioxide in a biogeochemical cascade. We further show that re-wetting the peat accelerates carbon losses to the atmosphere and receiving waters, owing to drought-induced increases in nutrient and labile carbon levels, which raise pH and stimulate anaerobic decomposition. We suggest that severe drought, and subsequent re-wetting, could destabilize peatland carbon stocks; understanding this process could aid understanding of interactions between peatlands and other environmental trends, and lead to the development of strategies for increasing carbon stocks.","2011-12","2025-01-08 20:46:36","2025-03-12 01:56:26","","895-900","","12","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18.3","1","SC: 0000715","<p>- This paper examines how low water table affects decomposition and carbon cycling in peat using a mesocosm study. </p>","","","biogeochemistry; climate change; hydrology; peatland; decomposition; peat; nutrients; water table; drawdown; carbon cycle; substrate; hydrological alteration; drought","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the Oil Sands Region of Alberta, Canada, human development related to oil and gas extraction occurs in a wetland-dominated landscape. Wetland monitoring programs can determine the extent to which development impacts wetlands, but existing monitoring programs focus on characterizing biodiversity across the region and on compliance and regulatory monitoring that assumes impacts from oil sands development do not extend past lease boundaries. This is unlikely to be true since some impacts, such as particulate deposition, can extend over large areas contingent on local weather and topography. To inform the development of a new regional wetland monitoring program to assess the cumulative effects of oil sands development on wetlands, we synthesized information on the scope of wetland research across the Oil Sands Region, including the anthropogenic stressors that impact wetlands and the wetland characteristics sensitive to different disturbances. We developed a conceptual model linking human development with wetland ecology in the region to make explicit the relationships among oil sands development stressors and different components of wetland ecosystems. By highlighting testable relationships, this conceptual model can be used as a collection of hypotheses to identify knowledge gaps and to guide future research priorities. relationships among We found that the majority of studies are short-term (77% were <= 5 years) and are conducted over a limited spatial extent (82% were sub-regional). Studies of reclaimed wetlands were relatively common (18% of all tests); disproportionate to the occurrence of this wetland type. Results from these studies likely cannot be extrapolated to other wetlands in the region. Nevertheless, the impacts of tailings contaminants, wetland reclamation activities, and surface water chemistry are well-represented in the literature. Research on other types of land disturbance is lacking. A coordinated, regional monitoring program is needed to gain a complete understanding of the direct and indirect impacts of human development in the region and to address remaining knowledge gaps.","2022-02","2025-01-08 20:46:36","2025-09-09 20:49:35","","47-66","","1","30","","Wetlands Ecol.

Many seismic lines have experienced poor tree regeneration since initial disturbance, with most failures occurring in treed peatlands that are used by the threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Extensive networks of seismic lines, which often reach densities of 40 km/km(2), are thought to have contributed to declines in caribou. The reforestation of seismic lines is therefore a focus of conservation. Methods to reforest seismic lines are expensive (averaging $12,500 per km) with uncertainty of which seismic lines need which treatments, if any, resulting in inefficiencies in restoration actions. Here, we monitored the effectiveness of treatments on seismic lines as compared to untreated seismic lines and adjacent undisturbed reference stands for treed peatlands in northeast Alberta, Canada. Mechanical site preparation (mounding and ripping) increased tree density when compared to untreated lines, despite averaging 3.8-years since treatment (vs. 22 years since disturbance for untreated). Specifically, treated lines had, on average, 12,290 regenerating tree stems/ha, which is 1.6-times more than untreated lines (7680 stems/ha) and 1.5-times more than the adjacent undisturbed forest (8240 stems/ha). Using only mechanical site preparation, treated seismic lines consistently have more regenerating trees across all four ecosites, although the higher amounts of stems that were observed on treated poor fens are not significant when compared to untreated or adjacent undisturbed reference stands.","2019-02","2025-01-08 20:46:36","2025-03-12 01:43:33","","","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.9","2","SC: 0000059","<p>- This paper describes methods for the restoration of seismic lines using mechanical preparation and presents the results of vegetation monitoring.</p>","","","Canada; species-at-risk; peatland; linear disturbance; on-site restoration; seismic lines; vegetation; vascular plants; bog; caribou; caribou, boreal population; active restoration; microtopography; passive restoration; fen; mitigation hierarchy; mineral exploration; fauna; mammals; woody plants; physiography; revegetation; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lack of recovery is common in unproductive forests, such as treed peatlands, because of conditions that limit tree growth, including simplification of microtopography (loss of microsites). The persistence of these features affects biodiversity, but of particular concern in Canada is the detrimental effects on threatened woodland caribou. Although natural regeneration of trees in peatlands occurs in some places, it is not an effective recovery strategy for restoring the habitat of woodland caribou. This has led to restoration activities with costs exceeding CAD$12 500/km. However, current restoration does not consider wildfires, which can destroy planted trees but also initiate early seral conditions that favor natural regeneration. Here we compared tree regeneration on seismic lines and adjacent forest controls for burnt (75 sites) and unburnt (68 sites) treed peatlands in northeast Alberta, Canada. Tree regeneration (stems with a DBH < 1 cm/ha) varied from 28 500 in burnt lines, 11 440 in unburnt lines, and 18 210 in burnt forest, to 9520 in unburnt forest. Wildfires promoted denser regeneration in sites with a greater proportion of serotinous species and water table depth.

These impacts arise from historical construction methods that used bulldozers to remove vegetation and substrate leaving lines as persistent openings in a state of arrested succession. In the mid-1990s, “low-impact seismic” (LIS) line construction began, using mulchers to remove vegetation aboveground to minimize impacts and hasten reforestation. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of LIS in retention, recruitment, and growth of seedlings in forested peatlands in northeast British Columbia. Retained and recruited trees on LIS lines were found at 69% and 64% of sites, had mean densities of 3400 and 6000 stems/ha, and mean heights of 42 and 11 cm, respectively. These LIS lines appeared to recover along expected trajectories toward tree cover, thereby mitigating challenges typical of older seismic exploration.

Understanding how wildlife responds to different types and characteristics of linear features is necessary for coordinated landscape restoration. Currently, linear feature restoration is focused on recovering threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus) which may have unintended impacts on other boreal species like moose (Alces alces). Understanding how moose respond to different linear features can help ensure restoration is targeted and effective. We used GPS data from seven moose collected between 2008 and 2010 to investigate response to linear features and to determine how moose response was influenced by characteristics of linear features like the surrounding habitat and regeneration. At the landscape scale, moose selected areas closer to seismic lines when they were in areas with lower densities of seismic lines and higher densities of harvest blocks and wildfires. This response was stronger during winter. Moose selected areas closer to pipelines when they were in areas with lower densities of other linear features, harvest blocks, and wildfires and were indifferent to roads at the population-level. At the fine scale, during winter, moose selected areas closer to seismic lines regardless of vegetation height or the surrounding habitat, but were indifferent to seismic lines during summer, and were indifferent to roads and pipelines during summer and winter. Combined, our results suggest that there are characteristics of seismic lines which make them attractive to moose regardless of the regeneration height on the seismic lines, providing further evidence that effective linear feature restoration will need to address the fact that linear features increase landscape permeability and provide forage for multiple boreal wildlife species. Our results also further illustrate the importance of considering how linear feature restoration efforts focused on caribou may shift the distribution of other boreal wildlife species. Ultimately, conservation efforts for threatened species should recognize that conservation efforts focused on one species may have unintended consequences for interacting species.","2023-08","2025-01-08 20:46:36","2025-03-07 18:19:48","","","","8","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.7","2","SC: 0000004","<p>- This paper examines the characteristics of seismic lines on moose movement in the boreal forest.

The effect of seismic lines and associated habitat fragmentation on boreal wildlife is generally well understood, and most recently seismic lines have been focus of habitat restoration efforts to conserve declining woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations. However, despite decades of research assessing wildlife response to seismic lines, little is known about the effects of seismic line clearing on the quality of understory forage for wildlife, or about the resilience of boreal understory communities to seismic line clearing. Using field data collected from 351 seismic lines across west-central and north-western Alberta, Canada, and focusing on forage taxa preferred by moose and bears, we (1) investigated whether understory forage taxa composition differed among seismic lines, seismic line edges, and the interior forest, and (2) assessed how this relationship changed as a function of seismic line attributes (ecosite, orientation, level of motorized human use, regeneration). Although we found regional differences and differences among ecosites, generally disturbance-tolerant forbs and graminoids were more abundant on seismic lines, Rhododendron spp. and Vaccinium vitis-idaea were more abundant on edges, and Alnus, Saint and Betula spp. were more abundant on edges and seismic lines. Attributes of seismic lines did not explain patterns of understory forage abundance, although we found positive relationships between motorized human use and abundance of Chamerion spp. and non-target graminoids. With habitat restoration for caribou in mind, this study increases understanding of patterns of understory forage availability on seismic lines, which could help prioritize seismic line restoration efforts to reduce forage attractive to primary wolf prey (moose), and bears, and decrease the spatial overlap between caribou and predators. Overall, our results reveal that even decades after construction, understory forage on seismic lines is different from the interior forest, and is similar to that of harvest blocks. Silviculture and reforestation are recognized as key components for the recovery of harvested areas, and our results suggest that the same treatments may be needed to re-establish or maintain natural successional trajectories on seismic lines. By focusing on habitat changes that influence wildlife responses, such as changes in the presence and abundance of forage used by moose and bears, this study provides valuable insight into the need for active restoration of seismic lines to restore boreal forest ecosystems.","2018-02","2025-01-08 20:46:36","2025-03-12 01:49:52","","634-652","","","409","","For.

These impacts are perhaps most profound in forest ecosystems like the Canadian boreal forest which has been fragmented by an extensive network of seismic lines which affect a number of boreal species. Of particular concern are the impacts of seismic lines on boreal and mountain woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), which are declining across Canada primarily because of an increase in anthropogenic habitat disturbance including seismic lines, within their ranges. Restoring seismic lines is a focus of conservation efforts for caribou, however their extensive footprint implies that restoration efforts will need to be prioritized to target the ultimate (habitat disturbance, early seral stage vegetation), and proximate (wolf predation) causes of caribou declines. To help inform restoration efforts we used field data collected in 2014 and 2015 from 291 seismic lines in west-central and north-western Alberta, Canada, and GIS-derived and remote sensing (LiDAR) data to model and map vegetation recovery (growth, structure, and composition) on seismic lines and along seismic line edges. Although we found differences among regions and taxa, generally we found that wet seismic lines and seismic lines adjacent to open forest stands were more likely to have more early seral stage vegetation that is attractive wildlife forage. We also found that in west-central Alberta, wet seismic lines had less vegetation growth and cover, while in north-western Alberta, wet seismic lines were more likely to have more vegetation cover, but there was no relationship between vegetation growth on seismic lines and seismic line wetness. Using field data we predicted that vegetation on seismic lines within our study area had grown between 1 and 2 m between 2007 and 2015; however as our models of vegetation growth did not validate well other techniques (e.g. UAVs) and studies focused at smaller scales are likely to provide accurate data on current vegetation height and cover on seismic lines. Our results combined with results from previous research provide further evidence that seismic lines, particularly wet seismic lines, need active restoration to re-establish natural vegetation trajectories.

Seismic lines are the most pervasive linear disturbance associated with oil and gas development in the boreal forests of western North America. The width and orientation of seismic lines may influence microclimatic edge effects that could alter biotic responses, including tree recruitment. We examined light intensity, air temperature, relative humidity, and tree regeneration within seismic lines and adjacent forests to: (1) compare abiotic conditions between wide (6.8 m) and narrow (3.4 m) seismic lines; (2) quantify microclimatic edge effects of seismic lines of different widths and orientations; and (3) relate patterns in tree regeneration density to local patterns in the abiotic environment. We sampled interior forests and 24 seismic lines that were wide or narrow and orientated east-west or north-south in poor mesic ecosites of northeast Alberta, Canada. Microclimatic conditions in seismic line centres were generally intermediate between interior forest and well pads, with narrow seismic lines more similar to interior forest and wide seismic lines more similar to well pads. Light intensity on wide seismic line centres was at least 1.5 times higher than on narrow seismic line centres and up to 3.8 times higher than interior forest. Edge effects on light intensity extended up to 10 m into the forest adjacent to wide lines, but were restricted to the forest edge (at the interface) of narrow lines. Compared to interior forest, day temperature was up to 2.8 <sup>o</sup>C and 0.8 <sup>o</sup>C higher at edges of wide and narrow seismic lines, respectively. Relative humidity during the day was up to 7.3% and 3% lower at the edges of wide and narrow seismic lines, respectively, as compared to interior forest. At night, wide seismic line centres were up to 1.7 <sup>o</sup>C cooler and up to 8.2% more humid than narrow seismic line centres. Tree regeneration was highest where light intensity was highest (the centre of wide north-south seismic lines) and a 10-fold increase in light intensity resulted in 5.8 times more regenerating trees. This study reveals that seismic line width and orientation affect abiotic factors within the linear disturbance and up to 10 m into the adjacent forest. Edge effects on the microclimate of seismic lines were most pronounced in wider seismic lines and along north (south-facing) forest edges. These findings provide a better understanding of the abiotic factors influencing biotic responses to linear anthropogenic disturbances.","2021-07","2025-01-08 20:46:36","2025-03-07 22:08:29","","","","","492","","For.

To encourage further debate, the paper develops a set of sustainable development principles for the disposal of mining and mineral processing wastes, and discusses the implications for current and future practise. In practise, the principles can guide waste disposal decisions through the consideration of what risk and magnitude, in any given local context, a particular management solution poses to their application. The sustainability challenge in the management of tailings and waste rock is to dispose of material, such that it is inert or, if not, stable and contained, to minimise water and energy inputs and the surface footprint of wastes and to move toward finding alternate uses. Future trends in mining and processing may compound the challenges of waste management, as lower ore grades increase the ratio of waste produced for a given unit of resource, and emphasise the urgency and need for the industry to adopt new approaches. New technologies and innovations, such as thickened tailings, dry stacking and paste backfill, have greatly increased the waste disposal methods available to meet the future challenges to sustainable development.","2011","2025-01-08 20:46:37","2025-03-12 12:53:36","","114-122","","2","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10.2","","SC: 0000465","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This article presents modern principles for environmentally sustainable tailings management. &nbsp;Newer techniques such as thickened or paste tailings are partially dewatered tailings that eliminate the need for large tailings slurry ponds and consequently reduce the footprint of mines and reduce the landscape conversion.

Most peatlands with fen-type residual peat have problems regenerating a plant cover satisfactorily from a restoration point of view. We nevertheless found a site (Moss Spur, Manitoba, Canada) presenting a substantial and diversified spontaneous plant cover. We estimated that the site would provide insights about natural revegetation processes operating in peatlands. Vegetation assemblages and environmental conditions were surveyed 19 years after extraction activities ceased. Moss Spur has densely revegetated (163 plant species, vegetation cover of 94%) with minimal human assistance. However, the composition of plant assemblages varies considerably across the site, depending on certain abiotic variables, particularly water pH, water table level, and the thickness of the residual peat layer. Moss Spur was remarkably wet considering the past peat extraction activities and the absence of active rewetting procedures. The high water table level may in part explain the successful revegetation. However, plant assemblages were not of equal quality from a restoration perspective. Some assemblages were highly diversified, and especially those dominated by Scirpus cyperinus, a species that should be further considered in peatland restoration projects to direct the recovery of the peatland towards a natural fen species composition.","2018-11","2025-01-08 20:46:37","2025-03-07 18:20:11","","779-791","","11","96","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1.1","4","SC: 0000016","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the natural revegetation of an peat extraction peatland.

The fate of permafrost peatlands and their element stores is unknown due to complex feedbacks between peat accumulation, hydrology, and vegetation that affect redox state and element mobility. We combine palynology with study of plant macrofossils, testate amoebae, organic matter composition, and bulk geochemistry preserved in a ca. 4180-4972 cal year old peat monolith retrieved from the Handle Lake peatland to reconstruct the ecohydrological dynamics to assess future trajectories of permafrost peat, and contaminant storage or release, in response to current and future warming. <i>Sphagnum riparium</i> macrofossils are rare in modern peat habitats and sub-fossils are rare in paleoecological records. Plant macrofossils of this taxon occur in an 11-cm thick layer together with <i>Sphagnum angustifolium</i> between 43 cm (ca. 3390-3239 cal BP) and 25 cm depth (ca. 2755-2378 cal BP) in the monolith. The <i>S. riparium</i> sub-fossils are present with the hydrophilous testate amoebae species Archerella flavum, Hyalosphenia papilio and Difflugia globulosa that are used to quantitatively reconstruct a water table depth of 0-4 cm below the peat surface. Sub-fossils of S. riparium disappear at ca. 2755-2378 cal BP, likely due to an autogenic trophic shift and succession towards more acidophilic conditions favourable to species such as Sphagnum fuscum and Sphagnum russowii. We interpret the occurrence of S. riparium as an indicator of wet and minerotrophic conditions linked to peatland development form rich fen to oligotrophic bog. Because S. riparium is a key pioneer species of disturbed peatlands that have experienced permafrost degradation it will likely be favoured in northern regions experiencing rapid climate warming. In the palynological record the proportion of Sphagnum-type A spores increases (up to 80%) between ca. 3390-3239 cal BP and ca. 2755-2378 cal BP concurrent with a decline in other Sphagnum-type spores. A peak in micro- and macroscopic charcoal occurs between ca. 3557-3286 cal BP and ca. 3275-2771 cal BP, concurrent with a decline in Picea pollen and an increase in Alnus pollen. Regionally, between ca. 3500 and ca. 2500 cal BP Neoglacial climate prevailed with post-Neoglacial warming at ca. 2500 cal BP. It is therefore possible that regional fire occurrence stimulated permafrost degradation at ca. 3500 cal BP. Background As in the active layer monotlith is approximately 20-30 ppm. The upper 10 cm of the peat are impacted by aerial deposition of As from ore processing and concentrations range up to approximately 360 ppm. An increase in the concentration of As in the monolith from approximately 15-20 ppm at the base of the monolith to approximately 30-40 ppm during this interval may reflect water table depth dynamics that affected the mobility and fate of this redox sensitive element and/or downward mobility from layers impacted by contamination from mineral processing. Degradation of this permafrost within the Handle Lake peatland will release the currently stored As and other contaminants to the regional environment. [Copyright Author(s) 2020.

The observed decrease in undrained shear strength with increasing organic content for these sapric peats is opposite to the effect on those fibric peats discussed in previous studies. The resilient strain, permanent strain and excess pore water pressure of the sapric peat samples were found to be significantly dependent on the cyclic stress ratio (CSR) and organic content.

In a restored cutover peatland in Quebec, Canada, this resulted in a lower soil water content of the regenerated Sphagnum moss compared to a natural analogue, which may limit carbon sequestration potential. Previous work has shown it may take > 40 years for the regenerated moss layer to overcome this capillary barrier effect, however mechanical compression may provide a novel restoration technique to weaken the capillary barrier in restored peatlands. This study evaluated the effectiveness of field-based mechanical compression to ameliorate the capillary barrier effect and increase the moisture content in a restored cutover peatland. A section of restored Bois-des-Bel peatland was compressed using a John Deere 6430 series tractor in January 2016, followed by hydrological monitoring May-August. The Compressed site was compared to a nearby Uncompressed site, and a natural peatland similar to 2 km away, to determine relative success of mechanical compression. The compression reduced moss height by 48%, increasing bulk density by 37% and reducing the proportion of macropores by 15% throughout the moss layer. Consequently, compression increased soil water retention and average soil moisture content at the Compressed site was consistently higher throughout the moss profile than in the Uncompressed site. This increased the resilience of the moss to drying, though the degree of increased resilience is unknown. Despite not having the same hydrophysical properties of the Natural site, the Compressed site was wetter than the Uncompressed site due to the lessening of the capillary barrier effect and moving the surface closer to the water table, thus decreasing the water stress of the regenerated Sphagnum carpet.","2022-09","2025-01-08 20:46:37","2025-03-07 22:07:53","","","","","612","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6.4","1","","<p>- This paper examines how the compression of <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses improves capillary flow closer to the restored peatland surface. </p>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; peat; substrate disturbance; soil moisture; bryophytes; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; substrate rehabilitation; substrate; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in restored peatlands, a capillary barrier resulting from distinctly different pore-size distributions in the degraded remnant cutover peat and regenerated Sphagnum moss limits capillary rise. Space-for-time analogues suggest it could take >40 years for decomposition and degradation of the moss profile to overcome this capillary barrier effect. This paper explores the feasibility of mechanical compression to ameliorate the capillary barrier effect and accelerate the return of ecohydrological function in restored Sphagnum moss. Seven reference cores (10 x 20 cm) and 29 samples (10 x 5 cm) representing various depths from surface (0-5 cm, n = 9; 5-10 cm, n = 9; 10-15 cm, n = 7; 15-20 cm, n = 4) were tested in a laboratory setting to analyse pre-compression and post-compression water retention-unsaturated hydraulic conductivity relationships, proportion of macropores, and other hydrophysical parameters. Post-compression, reference core moss height (originally 20 cm) decreased by 5.5 +/- 1.2 cm, and sample bulk density increased, while porosity decreased (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.01). Increased water retention and subsequent increase in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity post-compression was a result of a decrease in macropores (diameter > 75 mu m). Simulation results with Hydrus-1D indicate that the post-compression moss profile was better suited to maintain pressure heads above critical values for photosynthesis. These findings suggest that mechanical compression may be used to ameliorate the capillary barrier effect in restored cutover peatlands; however, field scale studies are required.","2018-12","2025-01-08 20:46:37","2025-03-07 18:20:01","","","","8","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.6","3","SC: 0000029","<p>- This study uses peat cores to examine the effect of <i>Sphagnum</i> compression on capillary rise to aid in the establishment of <i>Sphagnum</i> using the moss layer transfer technique.</p>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; peat; substrate disturbance; soil moisture; bryophytes; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; substrate rehabilitation; substrate; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peat pore surface wettability, which is determined by pore surface chemistry, has strong hysteresis and shows hydrophilic and hydrophobic behaviors during water drainage from and water imbibition into pore spaces. This leads to high residual NAPL saturation in pore spaces. Systematic reduction of pore radius size with depth associated with greater peat decomposition in a typical peat profile leads to an increase in NAPL-entry capillary pressure and a reduction in peat permeability with increasing depth. The former leads to stronger capillarity in deeper peat horizons, causing resistance to NAPL percolation compared to that in shallow ones; along with decreased permeability with depth, this results in higher NAPL mobility in shallower peat. The cumulative effect is preferential horizontal migration of NAPL in shallow less decomposed peat horizons. Occupation of peat macro-pores by NAPL dramatically decreases the effective water permeability and leads to lower rates of water infiltration and groundwater discharge in the contaminated area. With respect to dissolved-phase hydrocarbons, the dual porosity structure of peat soil, which exhibits larger pores and higher effective porosity near the surface, also favours preferential transport in the surface peat layer, and leads to increasing solute retardation with depth. In addition, adsorption of hydrocarbon solutes onto natural dissolved organic carbon present in peat pore water influences the effective adsorption of hydrocarbon solutes onto peat by reducing the apparent adsorption partitioning coefficient. The concepts and evidence presented in this manuscript suggest both free-phase and dissolved-phase hydrocarbon have restricted mobility in peatlands. On this basis, in large peatlands where ecological function is not notably impacted, a case can be made for allowing natural processes to degrade the hydrocarbon, rather than the common response of digging up and disposing of contaminated soils, which destroys the ecosystem function.","2018","2025-01-08 20:46:38","2025-03-12 01:55:15","","55-68","","1","26","","Environ.

The redistribution of hydrocarbon liquids in groundwater systems are controlled by the multiphase flow characteristics of the aquifer material including capillary pressure-saturation-relative permeability (P (sub c) -S-k (sub r) ) relations. However, these relations have never been characterized for the hydrocarbon-water phases in peat. To address this, the flow and transport of diesel and water in peat soils were examined through a number of one dimensional vertical immiscible displacement tests, in which diesel was percolated into peat pore space displacing peat water, leading to a two-phase flow regime. Inverse modelling simulations using both Brooks and Corey's and power law relative permeability models, matched the data of the immiscible displacement tests well. Irreducible water saturation (S (sub wirr) ) and the curvature of water relative permeability relation increased with peat bulk density. The residual diesel saturation (S (sub Nr) ) ranged between 0.3% and 17% and increased with bulk density of peat. In a given peat, S (sub Nr) was a function of saturation history and increased with increasing maximum diesel saturation. The receding contact angles of water in water-air systems and diesel in diesel-air systems, respectively, were 51.7 degrees and 61.2 degrees , showing that the wetting tendency of peat in the air imbibition condition is toward the draining liquid. These experiments advance our knowledge on the behavior of hydrocarbons in peat, and can improve numerical modelling of hydrocarbon transport after a spill.","2019","2025-01-08 20:46:38","2025-03-12 01:55:18","","11-25","","","221","","J.

The adsorption of benzene and toluene and its dependency on peat depth, thus degree of decomposition, are investigated. The batch adsorption experiments revealed that benzene and toluene adsorption isotherms in peat are linear, with adsorption coefficients ranging from 16.2 to 48.7 L/kg and 31.6–48.7 L/kg, respectively. In a vertical peat profile benzene adsorption decreased with depth, while toluene adsorption increased. Considering toluene adsorption onto cellulose is significantly less than toluene adsorption onto humic substance, the increase in toluene adsorption was attributed to decreasing cellulose and increasing humic substances with depth. Negligible competition for adsorption was observed between benzene and toluene at the measured concentrations. The retardation factors of benzene and toluene ranged respectively from 3.5 to 10.7 and from 5.4 to 17.7, both increasing with depth. Higher retardation in deeper peat coupled with lower hydraulic conductivity will lead to a weaker solute velocity in deeper peat, thus preferential migration of these dissolved-phase contaminants in shallow layers. The results can help predict the behavior of dissolved hydrocarbons in peatlands after a hydrocarbon spill. Main finding of the work, Variation of contaminants’ adsorption coefficient coupled with increase in bulk density and inactive porosity along the peat profile leads to increasing contaminants’ retardation with depth.","2021","2025-01-08 20:46:38","2025-03-12 12:55:05","","","","","274","","Environ.

Characterizing the variation of these properties in a peat profile can increase our knowledge on the processes controlling contaminant transport through peatlands. As opposed to the common macro-scale (or bulk) representation of groundwater flow and transport processes, a pore network model (PNM) simulates flow and transport processes within individual pores. Here, a pore network modeling code capable of simulating advective and diffusive transport processes through a 3D unstructured pore network was developed; its predictive performance was evaluated by comparing its results to empirical values and to the results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. This is the first time that peat pore networks have been extracted from X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) images of peat deposits and peat pore characteristics evaluated in a 3D approach. Water flow and solute transport were modeled in the unstructured pore networks mapped directly from mu CT images. The modeling results were processed to determine the bulk properties of peat deposits. Results portray the commonly observed decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth, which was attributed to the reduction of pore radius and increase in pore tortuosity. The increase in pore tortuosity with depth was associated with more decomposed peat soil and decreasing pore coordination number with depth, which extended the flow path of fluid particles. Results also revealed that hydraulic conductivity is isotropic locally, but becomes anisotropic after upscaling to core-scale; this suggests the anisotropy of peat hydraulic conductivity observed in core-scale and field-scale is due to the strong heterogeneity in the vertical dimension that is imposed by the layered structure of peat soils. Transport simulations revealed that for a given solute, the effective diffusion coefficient decreases with depth due to the corresponding increase of diffusional tortuosity. Longitudinal dispersivity of peat also was computed by analyzing advective-dominant transport simulations that showed peat dispersivity is similar to the empirical values reported in the same peat soil; it is not sensitive to soil depth and does not vary much along the soil profile.","2018","2025-01-08 20:46:38","2025-03-12 12:55:06","","494-508","","","561","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6.4","1","SC: 0000079","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper models the transport of contaminants in peat.

Using an extensive collection of historical documents, as well as dendrochronological data, we reconstructed the history of the peatland. We also sampled vegetation and environmental variables, and integrated the data in a geographic information system. More than 60% of the total area of the bog was mined between 1942 and 1975, and 98 km of ditches were dug to drain the site. The peatland lost 34% of its initial peat volume between 1946 and 1998. Although the bog was severely disturbed, the spontaneous revegetation of the site by vascular plants was successful (90%-100% cover). However, only 10% of the total mined area has been recolonized by Sphagnum species, mainly because drainage ditches are still operational and contribute to drying out the bog. Water table level, peat deposit thickness, and pH are abiotic factors strongly influencing the vegetation composition in the bog. Spatial and historical factors are also important components in this study since they explain, either alone or in interaction with abiotic factors, 44% of the variation of the species data. The intensity of mining activities and the pattern of abandonment of mined sectors strongly influenced abiotic factors, which in turn affected the revegetation process. Even if the Sphagnum cover of the bog is low, the rapid ""recovery"" of the vegetation cover in the peatland indicates that after the reestablishment of an appropriate hydrological regime, a highly disturbed peatland has a considerable potential for regeneration.","2002-04","2025-01-08 20:46:38","2025-03-07 18:19:57","","274-288","","3","5","","Ecosystems","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.7","2","SC: 0000127","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the natural revegetation of a block-cut and vacuum-harvested extracted peatland in southeastern Québec. &nbsp;They relate the revegetation to hydrology, water table, pH and peat depth, but also to historical factors.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; peat; substrate disturbance; pH; water table; passive restoration; mitigation hierarchy; substrate; revegetation; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Hudson Bay Lowlands have been rising isostatically for the past 7000 years, creating a regional chronosequence as new land emerges from the sea. Rates of uplift are most rapid in the eastern portion of the lowlands near the lower Albany River study area. 2. The stratigraphy of three raised bogs was investigated to determine rates and pathways of peatland development in the Albany River region. The bogs are distributed evenly along the regional chronosequence from the oldest site at Oldman (5980 +/- 100 BP) to progressively younger sites at Albany River (4810 +/- 70) and Belec Lake (3960 +/- 60). 3. Each bog had the same stratigraphic sequence, beginning with a basal tidal marsh assemblage that was rapidly replaced by a Larix-dominated swamp forest, followed by a Picea-forested bog, and ultimately a non-forested bog. The bog-fen boundary is marked by the disappearance of fen indicators, dominance of bog-forming Sphagna, and a sharp decline in nitrogen. Each of these successional stages was associated with different rates of vertical growth. 4. The rate of successional change was more rapid at the younger sites, and their vertical growth curve was more curvilinear. The formation of a raised bog, for example, was 1.3 times more rapid at Albany River and 5.5 times more rapid at Belec Lake than at Oldman. Belec Lake reached its ultimate successional stage first, although it was the last site to emerge from the sea. 5. The differential rate of isostatic uplift across this region rather than climate was the principal environmental driver for peatland development. The faster rate of uplift on the lower reaches of the drainage basin continues to reduce the regional slope, impede drainage and shift river channels, continually altering the local hydrogeological setting. 6. Groundwater flow simulations based on the Dupuit equation show that the growth of these raised bogs was probably constrained by their local hydrogeological setting. Bog formation was first induced by the creation of interfluvial divides between headwardly eroding streams or shifting river channels, and further bog growth was ultimately constrained by the width of the interfluve and the depth of river incision. The Belec Lake bog was the first to approach its limiting height because its narrow interfluve could only support a low water-table mound. 7. Although peatland succession largely followed the same conservative pathway at each site, both the pace and direction of these pathways were set by geological processes, which are probably the decisive drivers for the evolution of this large peat basin.","2004-12","2025-01-08 20:46:38","2025-03-07 18:21:18","","1036-1053","","6","92","","J.

This article assesses the influence of drainage-related, peat physicochemical, meteorological, management and landscape factors on the vegetation of extracted peatlands that have been restored in this manner. It draws upon data from a unique long-term monitoring programme covering 53 restoration projects spanning 600 km across eastern Canada. The time since restoration ranged from 3 to 15 years, and the rehabilitated peatlands had on average three permanent plots where vegetation was recorded every two years. Overall, the study included 246 permanent plots and 946 observations (plots*year of survey). Redundancy and cluster analyses showed that successful restoration, defined by the dominance of a Sphagnum carpet (54% of all plots at the most recent observation), was mainly associated with effective blocking of the former secondary drainage network within the restored sector, while plots dominated by bare peat (24% of all plots) occurred more often if a hot summer followed restoration works and where higher proportions of the surrounding land were subject to peat extraction. Management decisions, such as the season when restoration work was carried out, also substantially influenced restoration outcomes. For example, restoring in spring increased the likelihood of initiating an alternative successional trajectory characterised by dominance of the pioneer moss Polytrichum strictum (22% of all plots). However, a tendency towards Sphagnum colonisation and the development of Sphagnum carpets was observed over time in practically all plots. These results will inform future restoration efforts using the moss layer transfer as a peatland restoration method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In these regions, there is particular interest in the potential mobilization of atmospherically deposited Hg sequestered in permafrost that is thawing at unprecedented rates. Permafrost thaw and the resulting ground surface subsidence transforms forested peat plateaus into treeless and permafrost-free thermokarst wetlands where inorganic Hg released from the thawed permafrost and draining from the surrounding peat plateaus may be transformed to MeHg. This study begins to characterize the spatial distribution of MeHg in a peat plateau–thermokarst wetland complex, a feature that prevails throughout the wetland-dominated southern margin of thawing discontinuous permafrost in Canada's Northwest Territories. We measured pore water total Hg, MeHg, dissolved organic matter characteristics and general water chemistry parameters to evaluate the role of permafrost thaw on the pattern of water chemistry. A gradient in vegetation composition, water chemistry and dissolved organic matter characteristics followed a toposequence from the ombrotrophic bogs near the crest of the complex to poor fens at its downslope margins. We found that pore waters in poor fens contained elevated levels of MeHg, and the water draining from these features had dissolved MeHg concentrations 4.5 to 14.5 times higher than the water draining from the bogs. It was determined through analysis of historical aerial images that the poor fens in the toposequence had formed relatively recently (early 1970s) as a result of permafrost thaw. Differences between the fens and bogs are likely to be a result of their differences in groundwater function, and this suggests that permafrost thaw in this landscape can result in hotspots for Hg methylation that are hydrologically connected to downstream ecosystems.

The use of peat for energy in North America has always been small in scale. The demand for horticultural peat rose steadily after World War II on both continents (http://peatmoss.com/what-is-peat-moss/the-history-of-peat/). Currently, Europe and North America use peatmoss-peat extensively for landscaping, professional greenhouse production, hydrocarbon spills and waste water treatment. To date, in Canada, the main horticultural peat producers have impacted close to 20 000 ha. To place this into context, Canada's peatland extent is estimated to be around 125 000 000 ha with industrial activities mostly located on the southern margins of the peatland distribution. Most of the industrial peatlands are still in operation (16 000 ha), whereas close to 2000 ha have been restored according to the approach described below.With the rising awareness of goods and services provided by wetlands in the 1980–90s (Costanza et al. 1997), the international industrial peat sector recognised the impacts their activities had on peatland functions and developed a strategy for responsible peatland management. Several countries have since developed their own strategy and encourage the restoration of industrial peatlands (Clarke and Rieley 2010). For the case of Canada, peatland restoration is particularly driven by their main US horticultural clients, who demand responsible management of wetlands, driven by their interior policy on wetlands (NAWCA 1989). Based on two decades of trial-and-error experiments on restoring industrial peatlands, we have created a restoration framework. This framework draws on the ideas of assembly rules and restoration ecology. In this chapter, the framework is applied to restoring peatlands, but it should be applicable to the restoration of any ecosystem. The union of assembly rules and restoration ecology should be beneficial for both areas of ecology (Keddy 1999; Temperton et al. 2004). Assembly rules are a helpful tool for restoration because, if the constraints of community membership are defined, restoration efforts can focus on manipulating these constraints to steer succession towards the desired community (Temperton et al. 2004). Restoration ecology has been criticised for being a haphazard collection of individual cases (Keddy 1999).","2016","2025-01-08 20:46:39","2025-09-16 13:16:14","","192-212","","","","","","","Ecological Reviews","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","","","","","","Cambridge Core","","","<p>- This paper reviews the the ecological restoration framework for post-extraction peatlands in Canada.</p>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; substrate disturbance; bryophytes; sphagnum; active restoration; mitigation hierarchy; revegetation; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","Bonn, Aletta; Allott, Tim; Evans, Martin; Joosten, Hans; Stoneman, Rob","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of particular concern are drained and mined peatlands, where management practices destabilize an array of ecohydrological feedbacks, moss traits and peat properties that moderate water and carbon losses in natural peatlands. Our results demonstrate that drained and mined peatlands in Canada and northern Europe can experience catastrophic deep burns (>200 t C ha(-1) emitted) under current weather conditions. Furthermore, climate change will cause greater water losses in these peatlands and subject even deeper peat layers to wildfire combustion. However, the rewetting of drained peatlands and the restoration of mined peatlands can effectively lower the risk of these deep burns, especially if a new peat moss layer successfully establishes and raises peat moisture content. We argue that restoration efforts are a necessary measure to mitigate the risk of carbon loss in managed peatlands under climate change.","2016-06-27","2025-01-08 20:46:39","2025-03-07 18:20:55","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4.6","3","SC: 0000096","<p>- This paper examines the effect of fire on carbon loss in northern peatlands and argues for rewetting to mitigate the risk.</p>","","","Canada; climate change; cumulative effects; fire; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; mining; peat; substrate disturbance; water table; drawdown; mitigation hierarchy; smouldering; substrate; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, porewater sampling is often limited in spatial and temporal resolution, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis of spatiotemporal variation in porewater chemistry. We examined depth profiles of porewater chemistry in four nearby peatlands that fall along a bog to rich fen gradient in northcentral Minnesota, USA. Porewater was sampled similar to monthly during one ice-free season from three replicate piezometer nests per peatland to quantify temporal and spatial variability of those depth profiles. Porewater depth profiles of pH, calcium and total organic carbon concentrations, and delta O-18-H2O varied along the bog to fen gradient, but total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations did not. Porewater chemistry was similar in the bogs and poor fen which were all quite different from the rich fen. In contrast, temporal and spatial variation in porewater chemistry, quantified using coefficients of variation, did not differ between bogs and fens despite the hypothesis that variation in porewater chemistry would be lower in fens than bogs due to the perennial throughput of large volumes of discharging groundwater in the rich fen. Spatial and temporal variability in porewater chemistry across all peatland types highlights the importance of collecting porewater samples in multiples over time in both near-surface and deeper peats. This variation can be important when scaling findings to the peatland scale, assessing the representativeness of peatlands within a larger landscape, and understanding variability in solute export to downstream ecosystems.

Column experiments were conducted on non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contaminated undisturbed peat core (0–35 cm) under static and fluctuating water table conditions. Water table fluctuations reduced residual NAPL saturation from 8.1-11.3% to 7.7–9.5%. Biodegradation of n-C8 and n-C12 along with oxidation of CH4 together produced high CO2 concentrations in the headspace. Clear patterns in dynamics in the microbial community structure were observed, with a more pronounced population growth. However, a significant loss of microbial richness was observed in contaminated columns. The result indicates that the phylum Proteobacteria benefited most from NAPL; however, their families differed between static and fluctuating water table conditions. This study established strong evidence that peat microbes and water table fluctuation can be an excellent tool for hydrocarbon removal and its control in peatlands.","2020","2025-01-08 20:46:40","2025-03-12 01:48:50","","","","","191","","Environ.

There has been no systematic evaluation of the role of different peat types on hydrocarbon migration. Thus, two-phase, and three-phase flow experiments were performed for living and partially decomposed peat cores from bog, fen, and swamp peatlands. Numerical simulations of water drainage were performed using HYDRUS-1D, diesel-water and diesel-water-air flow using MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST). Five water table (WT) fluctuations were imposed to explore its potential to reduce residual diesel saturation in peat columns. Our results demonstrate a good match of the relative water permeability (k (sub rw) ) - saturation (S) relations estimated using the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity-S relation derived from HYDRUS-1D modeling of two-phase flow, and k (sub rw) - S from MRST for three-phase flow, for all tested peat columns. Thus, we recommended using two-phase system based k (sub rw) - S predictions if multiphase data are unavailable for peatland sites' spill management plans. We found the discharge of water and diesel both increase with increasing hydraulic conductivity, while residual water and diesel were within the range of 0.42-0.52 and of 0.04-0.11, respectively. High diesel discharge rates suggest that quick spill-response is required to manage its spread in peatlands. Up to 29% of residual diesel saturation was yielded by the five WT fluctuations, and thus we strongly recommend WT manipulation as a first step towards diesel decontamination progression in peatlands.","2023","2025-01-08 20:46:40","2025-03-12 01:55:19","","","","","255","","J.

We used litterbags to study changes in total Hg (THg), methyl Hg (MeHg), carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) in 12 different plant tissues (birch, alder, blueberry, and Labrador tea leaves, bunchberry plants, jack pine needles, Sphagnum spp., Polytrichum spp., and Pleurozium spp. bryophytes, lichen, and fresh and extensively decomposed wood) placed on unflooded boreal forest soils and in experimentally created reservoirs over an apprx800 day period. Rates of decomposition (as indicated by differences in the percentage of C and N mass left in the tissues over time) were slower in plant tissues placed on unflooded soils compared to the same tissues that were inundated in reservoirs. Depending on tissue type and initial THg concentrations, decomposing litter on both unflooded and flooded soils was either a source or a sink for THg. Tissues where initial THg concentrations were greater than 30 ng g-1 represented a source of THg to the surrounding environment, whereas tissues that had initial concentrations of less than 30 ng g-1 gained THg mass. Initial rates of change in THg were more rapid in plant tissues placed in reservoirs compared to the same plant tissue placed on unflooded soils, but there were no differences in final THg masses after apprx800 days. Plant tissues placed in reservoirs exhibited large increases in MeHg mass, whereas MeHg mass decreased in the same plants placed on unflooded soils.

Specifically, we use subfossil chironomid, diatom, and pollen assemblages, non-pollen palynomorphs, sedimentary chlorophyll a, magnetic susceptibility, and organic matter content to characterize terrestrial and lake processes and to track paleoclimate following land emergence from the postglacial Tyrrell Sea. Following recession of the Tyrrell Sea (similar to 6600 cal yr BP), pollen assemblages are indicative of a salt marsh environment with the establishment of an opportunistic chironomid assemblage. By similar to 6200 cal yr BP, isostatic uplift reduced the marine influence and pollen and palynomorph assemblage changes indicate that North Raft Lake became a closed-basin freshwater system. At this time, pollen assemblages signify the establishment of a forested peatland dominated by Picea, and chironomid taxa indicate warming water temperatures. The North Raft Lake pollen/palynomorph record captures a warm and moist mid-Holocene (Holocene Thermal Maximum) period starting similar to 6200 cal yr BP. During this period, an increase in pollen concentration and a shift to higher abundances of Larix indicate watershed-scale succession and enhanced local ecosystem productivity. Shifts in chironomid taxa at similar to 5000 cal yr BP are indicative of abrupt limnological changes suggesting wet conditions that caused an expansion of littoral habitat. The gradual transition into Neoglacial cooling is signaled by an increase in the abundances of cold-stenothermal chironomid taxa and a small decline in pollen-reconstructed temperatures. Marked changes occur in the mid-twentieth century with the appearance of diatoms in notable abundances for the first time in the lake's sedimentary record, the arrival of new chironomid littoral taxa, and unprecedented increases in sedimentary chlorophyll a and organic matter content. Throughout the North Raft Lake Holocene sediment record, the pollen trends suggest slow centennial-scale changes in temperature and precipitation, whereas chironomid assemblages indicate abrupt mid-Holocene and twentieth century limnological changes, stressing that biota in lakes of the Hudson Bay Lowlands may change substantially under future scenarios of global climate warming.","2020-06","2025-01-08 20:46:40","2025-03-07 18:21:41","","25-46","","1","64","","J.

The overall goal of our research was to determine the ecological distribution and response of diatoms to microhabitat conditions, and to assess the potential for diatoms to be applied as indicators of long-term environmental change in northern peatlands. Our results indicate that diatom assemblage composition was determined by both the broader peatland type (i.e., bog, rich and poor fens) and microhabitats within peatland formations (e.g., hummock, hollow). The diatom assemblages were primarily influenced by pH with the sites divided at a critical pH of 5.5, and secondarily by the depth to the water table. Acidic bog hollow and hummock microhabitats were species-poor and dominated almost exclusively by Eunotia paludosa A.Grunow and (or) Eunotia mucophila (H.Lange-Bertalot, M.Norpel-Schempp & E.Alles) H.Lange-Bertalot. These acidophilic and aerophilic diatom species were associated with the narrow pH optima of the dominant Sphagnum L. species (e. g., Sphagnum fuscum (Schimp.) Klinggr., Sphagnum angustifolium (C.E.O.Jensen ex Russow) C.E.O.Jensen) found in these bog habitats. Rich and poor fen samples, which were less acidic, supported a more diverse diatom assemblage (>30 species) with greater variability in both diatom and bryophyte pH tolerances. The diatom assemblages recorded in the bogs and fens of our study are similar to those found in peatlands around the world, demonstrating that diatom species are very specialized to exist in these often harsh semi-aquatic environments.

Remote sensing is the most expeditious method of obtaining floristic information at landscape and regional scales, but the spatial complexity of many northern peatlands and the spectral similarity of a number of peatland vegetation species is such that the success of traditional methods of vegetation classification is often limited. Here, we assessed whether ordination and regression analyses may be a useful alternative method for mapping peatland plant communities from remote sensing data. We used isometric feature mapping (Isomap) to describe the community structure of the peatland vegetation and related the identified continuous floristic gradients to hyperspectral imagery (AISA Eagle) using partial least squares regression (PLSR). We performed the same analysis at two hierarchical levels of species aggregation in order to map continuous gradients in the composition of both species and plant functional types (PFTs), the latter of which is the most widely used level of aggregation in northern ecosystems. Isomap was able to transfer 82% and more than 96% of the observed ground-based observations to the ordination space for plots characterised by species and PFT; respectively. The modelled floristic gradients showed good agreement with ground-based species and PFT observations although the strength of the agreement was proportional to the amount of floristic variation explained by each ordination axis (r2val=0.74, 0.45 and 0.30 for the first three ordination axes and r2val=0.68 and 0.66 for the first two ordination axes; for species and PFT floristic gradients respectively). We also found that how a PFT is defined has an important influence on the success with which it can be mapped.

Despite the abundance of lichens in northern peatlands, our understanding of their role within peatland ecosystems, and peat accumulation in particular, is limited. We investigate the potential effect of these mat-forming lichens on peat production and decomposition processes, using field data from an ombrogenous bog in the HBL and laboratory analyses. We hypothesize that (a) production in lichen-shrub hummocks is less than in Sphagnum-shrub hummocks; (b) the decay of lichen litter is faster than that of Sphagnum moss, so the mass litter input to the peat profile is reduced; and (c) faster decomposition of the underlying peat is stimulated by lichen leachates, resulting in greater mass loss. We found that thick lichen mats alter vegetation composition in peatlands, reducing Sphagnum cover and inhibiting the growth of small shrubs. Coupled with low lichen productivity that is constrained by moisture conditions, production for lichen-shrub hummocks is significantly smaller than for Sphagnum-shrub hummocks, confirming hypothesis (a). Our data also support hypothesis (b), with chemical analyses of lichen mats and leachates from lichen mats indicating faster decay of lichens compared to Sphagnum moss, and therefore reduced mass litter input to the peat profile in lichen-dominated hummocks. Although we found no evidence to suggest leachates from lichens enhance decomposition processes in peatlands (hypothesis c), larger dry bulk densities for peat under lichen mats indicate a loss of structural integrity and potential collapse of the peat column.Synthesis. As production of new material added to the peat column is less in lichen-dominated hummocks, local peat accumulation slows or ceases, representing a potential temporary limit to peat growth. Our results highlight the importance of lichens as a vegetation feedback in peatland development, with thick mats probably constraining or reducing hummock height relative to adjacent, lichen-free hollows.","2018-11","2025-01-08 20:46:41","2025-03-07 18:27:48","","2301-2319","","6","106","","J.

We anticipated that drainage would change peatland hydrology, vegetation, and biogeochemistry, leading to an increase in peat decomposition. As indicators of peat biogeochemical change and potential proxies for peat decomposition, we compared peat porewater chemistry and in situ nutrient availability of different microforms in a pristine ombrogenous bog, with a bog that has been subject to gradual lowering of the water table by 20 to 80 cm for approximately 7 years prior to, and during, our study. We also examined the chemical composition of peat and peat leachates (organic matter) from Sphagnum and lichen-covered hummocks at each site. Nutrient availability was greater in pools at the drained bog, indicating mineralisation of the dry and bare peat surface. However, our results did not show evidence of significant peat biogeochemical change or advanced decomposition in hummocks at the drained bog, with no difference in nutrient availabilities, peat porewater chemistry, or peat leachate chemistry at the drained and pristine bog. We also found no significant difference in enzyme activity (phenol oxidases) in hummocks at each site, proposed to be an important factor for C loss from peatland ecosystems in drier conditions. Overall, the effects of drainage on peat properties, porewater chemistry, and peat chemical composition at our sites were small and varied for different vegetation-microform types. Although decomposition in drained peatlands is likely constrained by cool temperatures in the HBL, our results suggest that ecohydrological feedbacks at the microform scale may also be important in slowing decomposition in these peatlands.","2020","2025-01-08 20:46:41","2025-03-07 18:21:18","","43-62","","1","151","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SC: 0000024","<p>- This paper examines the effects of drainage on peatland pore chemistry. <br/>- The  effects of drainage on peat properties, porewater chemistry, and peat chemical composition were small.</p>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; hydrology; peatland; vegetation; bog; decomposition; peat; nutrients; water table; drawdown; carbon cycle; sediment; Hudson Bay Lowland; substrate; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We collected 15 complete peat cores (between 2.7 and 4.5 m deep) along four chronosequences, from elevated permafrost peat plateaus to saturated thermokarst bogs that thawed up to 600 years ago. The peat cores were analysed for peat C storage and peat quality, as indicated by decomposition proxies (FTIR and C/N ratios) and potential decomposability using a 200-day aerobic laboratory incubation. Our results suggest net C loss following thaw, with average total peat C stocks decreasing by ~19.3 ± 7.2 kg C m−2 over <600 years (~13% loss). Average post-thaw accumulation of new peat at the surface over the same period was ~13.1 ± 2.5 kg C m−2. We estimate ~19% (±5.8%) of deep peat (>40 cm below surface) C is lost following thaw (average 26 ± 7.9 kg C m−2 over <600 years). Our FTIR analysis shows peat below the thaw transition in thermokarst bogs is slightly more decomposed than peat of a similar type and age in permafrost plateaus, but we found no significant changes to the quality or lability of deeper peat across the chronosequences. Our incubation results also showed no increase in C mineralization of deep peat across the chronosequences. While these limited changes in peat quality in deeper peat following permafrost thaw highlight uncertainty in the exact mechanisms and processes for C loss, our analysis of peat C stocks shows large C losses following permafrost thaw in peatlands in western Canada.","2023","2025-01-08 20:46:41","2025-03-07 18:27:29","","5720-5735","","19","29","","Global Change Biol.","","","","","","","","","","","","","11.6","1","SC: 0000015","<p>- This paper examines the long-term loss of carbon from northern peatlands as a result of permafrost thaw following climate change.</p>","","","Canada; climate change; peatland; permafrost; permafrost thaw; bog; decomposition; peat; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Feedbacks among biological and hydrological processes maintain the long-term stability of peatlands, but if hydrological thresholds are passed, these feedbacks may be weakened, causing a shift in ecosystem state and potentially large losses of carbon (C). To determine peatland response to hydrological change, we examined the structure (vegetation composition and hydrology) and biogeochemical function (carbon dioxide exchange) of a pristine bog and a bog subject to ∼7 years localised drainage (caused by regional groundwater drawdown due to mine dewatering) in the Hudson Bay Lowland, Canada. Water tables at the drained bog were ∼1 m below the hummock surface at the time of study compared to ∼0.3 m at the pristine bog. For hummocks and intermediate microforms at the drained bog, plant production was significantly less than at the pristine bog, most likely due to small changes in vegetation structure (reduced Sphagnum cover and smaller shrub leaf:stem ratios) caused by deeper water tables and significantly reduced moisture content of surface peat. Despite these changes in vegetation and hydrology, net ecosystem production (NEP) remained positive (C sink) for these microforms at the drained bog. Dry pools with mostly bare peat at the drained bog had negative NEP (C source to atmosphere), in stark contrast to Sphagnum- and sedge-dominated pools at the pristine bog with small but positive NEP. Our study shows that dry pools now occupy an unstable state, but the hydrological thresholds for a shift in ecosystem state have not yet been reached for hummocks and intermediate microforms at the drained bog. However, weak or no relationships between water table depth, peat surface moisture content, and plant production for these microforms at the drained bog, suggest that drainage has weakened the hydrological feedbacks regulating peat production, causing peat accumulation to slow. If drier conditions prevail, this reduced resilience increases the potential for a shift in ecosystem state and raises the risk of large C loss due to continued decomposition of deeper peat in oxic conditions, and wildfire.","2020-06-10","2025-01-08 20:46:41","2025-03-07 18:21:41","","065001","","6","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.9","4","SC: None[s0]","<p>- This paper examines the impacts of drawdown on the vegetation and carbon dynamics of a bog. </p>","","","Canada; Ontario; climate change; hydrology; peatland; vegetation; mining; bog; decomposition; water table; drawdown; carbon cycle; primary productivity; bryophytes; sphagnum; Hudson Bay Lowland; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hypotheses and models describe how small-scale feedbacks among vegetation, hydrology, and nutrients cause spatial differences in peat accumulation that enable microforms and surface patterns to develop over time. Empirical tests of the predictions from theoretical models of these proposed feedback mechanisms are limited, particularly in large peatland complexes such as the HBL. We investigate feedbacks controlling peatland structure and function in an ombrogenous bog and a minerogenous fen in the HBL. Our sites represent surface patterns found in many northern peatlands, specifically spatially irregular hummocks and hollows, and parallel ridges and pools that are perpendicular to slope. We found the occurrence of different spatial patterns depends on position within a peat landform, with these differences attributed to the ecohydrological setting. In turn, the ecohydrological setting, with different water table depths, nutrient availability, and species composition, influences the strength and direction of feedback mechanisms at the microform scale. Our data support the prediction of a positive feedback between plant productivity and acrotelm thickness for peat accumulation and hummock growth and that this may be enhanced by water ponding on slopes to form ridge-pool tracks. We did not find evidence to support the proposed feedback among evapotranspiration-driven transport of water and nutrients for the development of hummocks. Our results suggest a combination of mechanisms operating at various temporal and spatial scales is associated with the development of surface patterns in northern peatlands.","2020-06","2025-01-08 20:46:41","2025-03-07 21:59:20","","741-767","","4","23","","Ecosystems","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.7","2","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the controls for the development of microtopography in fen and bog peatlands in the Hudson Bay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; peatland; bog; decomposition; carbon cycle; primary productivity; microtopography; fen; Hudson Bay Lowland; physiography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper describes the design, construction, monitoring and operation of two replicate pilot peat-based wetlands subjected to two simulated freeze-thaw cycles. Undisturbed peat soil and pre-treated gold mine process wastewater were collected from a full-scale treatment wetland operating at a mining site in Northern Finland. The wastewater (pH ~7.8, electric conductivity ~3.6 mS/cm) contained a mix of metals/metalloids (e.g. arsenic 12 µg/L, antimony 19 µg/L) and other contaminants e.g. sulphate (~2 g/L). Fluctuations in removal efficiency of target compounds due to freezing and thawing conditions were observed. Overall, removal of sulphate and arsenic decreased during frost periods, while removal of antimony increased. Monitoring data from the full-scale treatment wetland were used to assess the representativeness of the results obtained. Comparisons of seasonal variations in pollutant concentrations in outflow samples from the full-scale wetland and those measured in the pilot wetlands revealed similar fluctuations in removal efficiency during frost and frost-free periods, suggesting that the pilot wetlands simulated the real system rather well. Carefully designed pilot systems can thus be valuable tools for assessing the effect of harsh winter conditions on wetland processes and operation.","2020-02-10","2025-01-08 20:46:41","2025-03-07 22:06:55","","134713","","","703","","Sci.

We analyse here the long-term treatment performance of these OFAs and DOFAs and factors affecting this performance. Data on 14 OFAs and DOFAs in different parts of Finland were taken from the extensive long-term environmental pollution control databases. Nearly half of these wetlands had been monitored for at least 4 years and seven for 8–23 years. The results indicated that peatland-based treatment wetlands purify drainage water as efficiently as other natural treatment wetlands on soils in general, the common challenge being phosphorus retention. Iron was also efficiently retained. The average reductions were highest in OFAs with good hydraulic function, and these also showed long-term water protection performance. An important factor affecting purification efficiency was the hydraulic loading rate. Important system design elements in this regard were the size of the wetland in relation to its catchment area, its gradient, the length of the water flow route within the wetland, and the efficient flow area of the wetland.

They also regulate regional climate through heat and water vapour exchange with the atmosphere. Understanding how land-atmosphere interactions in peatlands differ from forests may therefore be crucial for modelling boreal climate system dynamics and for assessing climate benefits of peatland conservation and restoration. To assess the biophysical impacts of peatlands and forests on peak growing season air temperature and humidity, we analysed surface energy fluxes and albedo from 35 peatlands and 37 evergreen needleleaf forests—the dominant boreal forest type—and simulated air temperature and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) over hypothetical homogeneous peatland and forest landscapes. We ran an evapotranspiration model using land surface parameters derived from energy flux observations and coupled an analytical solution for the surface energy balance to an atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) model. We found that peatlands, compared to forests, are characterized by higher growing season albedo, lower aerodynamic conductance, and higher surface conductance for an equivalent VPD. This combination of peatland surface properties results in a ∼20% decrease in afternoon ABL height, a cooling (from 1.7 to 2.5 °C) in afternoon air temperatures, and a decrease in afternoon VPD (from 0.4 to 0.7 kPa) for peatland landscapes compared to forest landscapes. These biophysical climate impacts of peatlands are most pronounced at lower latitudes (∼45°N) and decrease toward the northern limit of the boreal biome (∼70°N). Thus, boreal peatlands have the potential to mitigate the effect of regional climate warming during the growing season. The biophysical climate mitigation potential of peatlands needs to be accounted for when projecting the future climate of the boreal biome, when assessing the climate benefits of conserving pristine boreal peatlands, and when restoring peatlands that have experienced peatland drainage and mining.","2020-09-17","2025-01-08 20:46:41","2025-03-08 01:49:20","","104004","","10","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6.7","2","SC: 0000053","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the impacts of climate change on the energy flux in peatlands in the northern hemisphere.</p> </div>","","","Canada; climate change; energy balance; peatland; on-site restoration; mining; carbon cycle; impact avoidance; impact minimization; offsetting; mitigation hierarchy; climate; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used the stable isotopic composition of NO3– (δ15N- and δ18O-NO3–) to define and quantify the controls on NO3– composition in waste rock dumps by studying water-unsaturated and saturated conditions at nine coal waste rock dumps located in the Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada. Estimates of the extent of nitrification of NH4NO3 in oxic zones in the dumps, initial NO3– concentrations prior to denitrification, and the extent of NO3– removal by denitrification in sub-oxic to anoxic zones are provided. δ15N data from unsaturated waste rock dumps confirm NO3– is derived from blasting. δ15N- and δ18O-NO3– data show extensive denitrification can occur in saturated waste rock and in localized zones of elevated water saturation and low oxygen concentrations in unsaturated waste rock. At the mine dump scale, the extent of denitrification in the unsaturated waste rock was inferred from water samples collected from underlying rock drains.","2018-11-01","2025-01-08 20:46:42","2025-02-25 14:23:56","","127-137","","","640-641","","Sci.

A loading test experiment constrained values of vertical hydraulic conductivity within an order of magnitude for the peat below a depth of 2 m. An inherent advantage of these tests is that volumes of undisturbed peat on the scale of cubic metres may be characterized. Storativity of the fen peat as determined by enclosed drainage tests ranged from about 1·0 at the peat surface to 0·35 at a water table depth of 0·15 m. Laboratory drainage tests of peat cores gave similar, but widely scattered results. Hydraulic conductivity near the surface was as high as 9·0 × 10−3 ms−1 determined with pumping tests and in the range of 10−6 to 10−5 ms−1 below a depth of 2 m, estimated with the loading test.

In a subhumid climate, hydrogeological position is an important control on peatland hydrology and wildfire vulnerability. Consequently, we hypothesized that in a coarse-textured glaciofluvial outwash, isolated peatlands lacking the moderating effect of large-scale groundwater flow would have greater water table (WT) variability and would also be more vulnerable to deep WT drawdown and wildfire during dry climate cycles. A holistic approach was taken to evaluate 3 well-accepted factors that are associated with smouldering in boreal peatlands: hollow microform coverage, peatland margin morphometry, and gravimetric water content. Using a combination of field measurements (bulk density, humification, WT position, hummock–hollow distribution, and margin width) and modelling (1-D vertical unsaturated flow coupled with a simple peat–fuel energy balance equation), we assessed the vulnerability of peat to smouldering. We found that a peatland in the regionally intermediate topographic position is the most vulnerable to smouldering due to the interaction of variable connectivity to large-scale groundwater flow and the absence of mineral stratigraphy for limiting WT declines during dry conditions. Our findings represent a novel assessment framework and tool for fire managers by providing a priori knowledge of potential peat smouldering hot spot locations in the landscape to efficiently allocate resources and reduce emergency response time to smouldering events.","2018","2025-01-08 20:46:42","2025-03-20 18:53:19","","","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.6","3","SC: 0000028","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the presence of hot spots for smouldering fires in peatland landscapes.

This paper aims to test differences in runoff production processes between intact and drained blanket peat catchments and determine whether there have been any long-term changes in stream How since drainage occurred. Hillslope runoff processes and stream discharge were measured in four blanket peat catchments. Two catchments were drained with open-cut ditches in the 1950s. Ditching originally resulted in shorter lag times and flashier storm hydrographs but no change in the annual catchment runoff efficiency. In the period between 2002 and 2004, the hydrographs in the drained catchments, while still flashy, were less sensitive to rainfall than in the 1950s and the runoff efficiency had significantly increased. Drains resulted in a distinctive spatial pattern of runoff production across the slopes. Overland flow was significantly lower in the drained catchments where throughflow was more dominant. In the intact peatlands, matrix throughflow produced by peat layers below 10 cm was rare and produced < 1% of the runoff. However, in drained peatlands, matrix throughflow in deeper peat layers was common and provided around 23% of the runoff from gauged plots. Macropore flow, the density of soil piping, and pipeflow were significantly greater in drained peatlands than in intact basins. Gradual changes to peat structure could explain the long-term changes in river flow, which are in addition to those occurring in the immediate aftermath of peatland drainage.","2006-10","2025-01-08 20:46:42","2025-03-07 18:21:40","","1764-1778","","5","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.4","4","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of ditching of blanket peatlands on the hydrology of receiving waters.

We reconstructed water table depth using preserved testate amoebae in four stratigraphic peatland cores, supplemented with a literature review to investigate the effects of the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) on surface moisture and long-term apparent carbon accumulation (LARCA) in the regions. A 7320 calendar years before AD 1950 (yrBP) length record registered a wet shift at 4600 yrBP in concert with the HTM and a later post-2550 yrBP shift towards wetter and more stable conditions, possibly related to the Roman Warm Period. During the late-Holocene the three most southern boreal records indicated a lack of droughts during the MCA. Medieval pluvials in boreal Ontario would be consistent with North American precipitation patterns under La Nifia conditions. Of the three wet-warm periods identified (HTM, 2550 yrBP, MCA), the 2550 yrBP shift had the most consistent positive influence on LARCA regionally.

Peatland initiation lagged the retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet, the drainage of glacial lakes, and isostatic uplift by 810-6050 years. Transition from Carex-dominated fen to Sphagnum-dominated bog had a median timing of 3500 years following peatland establishment and ranged from 640 to 6970 years. LARCA was variable geographically and over time with median values ranging from 13.4 to 31.6 g C/m(2)/yr. LARCA anomalies were generally high similar to 6.1 kyr (kyr = 1000 calibrated years before present (cal. yr BP)) for southern sites, and similar to 2.5 kyr for the most northern sites, and may be associated with elevated moisture as inferred from a brief review of regional proxy reconstructions. Some sites displayed high LARCA anomalies, changes in plant ecology, or southern site initiation, which may have also been driven by a moist Hypsithermal Period occurring similar to 4.5 kyr. LARCA increases were not generally associated with high-temperature anomalies during the warm 'Medieval Climate Anomaly' compared with the cooler 'Little Ice Age'; however, there is evidence that the establishment of modern permafrost during the late-Holocene negatively affected C accumulation.","2014-09","2025-01-08 20:46:42","2025-03-07 18:21:18","","1075-1089","","9","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.4","3","SC: 0000025","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the long-term changes in water table and carbon sequestration in the Hudson Bay Lowlands using peat cores.

Here, we examine peatland C stability through five years of whole-ecosystem warming and two years of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO2). Warming exponentially increased methane (CH4) emissions and enhanced CH4 production rates throughout the entire soil profile; although surface CH4 production rates remain much greater than those at depth. Additionally, older deeper C sources played a larger role in decomposition following prolonged warming. Most troubling, decreases in CO2:CH4 ratios in gas production, porewater concentrations, and emissions, indicate that the peatland is becoming more methanogenic with warming. We observed limited evidence of eCO2 effects.

There is an extensive network of seismic lines in western Canada which is known to impact forest ecosystems, and seismic lines have been linked to declines in woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Seismic line restoration is costly, but necessary for caribou conservation to reduce cumulative disturbance. Understanding where motorized activity may be impeding regeneration of seismic lines will aid in prioritizing restoration. Our study area in west-central Alberta, encompassed five caribou ranges where restoration is required under federal species at risk recovery strategies, hence prioritizing seismic lines for restoration is of immediate conservation value. To understand patterns of motorized activity on seismic lines, we evaluated five a priori hypotheses using a predictive modeling framework and Geographic Information System variables across three landscapes in the foothills and northern boreal regions of Alberta. In the northern boreal landscape, motorized activity was most common in dry areas with a large industrial footprint. In highly disturbed areas of the foothills, motorized activity on seismic lines increased with low vegetation heights, relatively dry soils, and further from forest cutblocks, while in less disturbed areas of the foothills, motorized activity on seismic lines decreased proportional to seismic line density, slope steepness, and white-tailed deer abundance, and increased proportional with distance to roads. We generated predictive maps of high motorized activity, identifying 21,777km of seismic lines where active restoration could expedite forest regeneration.","2018-09","2025-01-08 20:46:42","2025-03-08 14:23:31","","595-607","","3","62","","Environ.

If intact peatlands are drained for agriculture or other human uses, peat oxidation can result in considerable CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases (GHG) for decades or even centuries. Despite their importance, emissions from degraded peatlands have so far not been included explicitly in mitigation pathways compatible with the Paris Agreement. Such pathways include land-demanding mitigation options like bioenergy or afforestation with substantial consequences for the land system. Therefore, besides GHG emissions owing to the historic conversion of intact peatlands, the increased demand for land in current mitigation pathways could result in drainage of presently intact peatlands, e.g. for bioenergy production. Here, we present the first quantitative model-based projections of future peatland dynamics and associated GHG emissions in the context of a 2 °C mitigation pathway. Our spatially explicit land-use modelling approach with global coverage simultaneously accounts for future food demand, based on population and income projections, and land-based mitigation measures. Without dedicated peatland policy and even in the case of peatland protection, our results indicate that the land system would remain a net source of CO2 throughout the 21st century. This result is in contrast to the outcome of current mitigation pathways, in which the land system turns into a net carbon sink by 2100. However, our results indicate that it is possible to reconcile land use and GHG emissions in mitigation pathways through a peatland protection and restoration policy. According to our results, the land system would turn into a global net carbon sink by 2100, as projected by current mitigation pathways, if about 60% of present-day degraded peatlands would be rewetted in the coming decades, next to the protection of intact peatlands.","2020-10-09","2025-01-08 20:46:42","2025-03-08 01:49:17","","104093","","10","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6.7","2","SC: 0000181","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper models the impact of climate change on greenhouse gas release from northern peatlands. &nbsp;It advocates for the protection and restoration of peatlands to mitigate climate change impacts on the global carbon cycle.</p> </div>","","","Canada; climate change; peatland; on-site restoration; greenhouse gases; carbon cycle; impact avoidance; offsetting; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We constructed random forest regression models with NMDS dimensions, i.e. floristic gradients, as response variables and satellite imagery variables as the predictors. Our results show that the floristic gradients in different peatland types should be monitored with different satellite imagery variables. However, midsummer NIR and red band consistently explain variation in the gradients in all peatland types. Our results indicate that the gradients and the post-restoration changes in them can be modelled with reasonable accuracy in open mires and sparsely treed pine mire forests but not in densely treed spruce mire forests.

They are commonly used to treat different types of waters, ranging from municipal wastewaters to mine effluent. This study evaluated the capacity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based thermal infrared (TIR) imaging, color infrared imaging, and stable water isotopes as a combined method for monitoring the functioning of a treatment peatland purifying mine process effluent water under boreal conditions in northern Finland. The results showed that TIR was an efficient tool for pinpointing cold groundwater seepage points in the peatland area that were not otherwise visible. Color infrared imaging was used to define Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as an indicator of plant health in the treatment area. A NDVI map of the area, measured on a day representing the main growing season (summer, +12 °C day temperature), revealed areas with stressed coniferous trees. This was probably due to excess water in these areas, resulting from successful spread of the process effluent water to the treatment peatland. Stable water isotopes were able to spatially differentiate the treated process effluent water, surface waters, and groundwater in different parts of the treatment peatland. This first attempt at combining these methods in monitoring of treatment peatlands was promising, as the results obtained with different methods complemented each other.

We examined how plant community properties responded to the restoration, and which environmental factors affected the restoration success. Location Restored peatlands along roadsides at E10, mainland connection to the Lofoten islands, northern Norway. Methods The restored area originally consisted of poor to intermediate Sphagnum-dominated natural peatlands. Restoration consisted of stripping and stockpiling the topmost (30 cm) peat. The peat was stored for 1–2 yr before redistribution, with no further hydrological management. We conducted first time analyses of plant community properties 8 and 9 yr after restoration. We recorded vegetation and environmental variables in 108 plots distributed between 18 transects running from the road edge over the restored area to the undisturbed peatland. Undisturbed peatland was used as target for successful restoration. We used CCA and ANOVA to test the effect of restoration on species composition and richness. Results The ordination showed that species composition still differed significantly between restored and undisturbed plots, indicating incomplete restoration after 8 and 9 yr. Soil moisture, pH, slope and microtopography were the most important environmental factors for species composition. Polytrichum mosses had a high percentage cover in restored (30%) compared to undisturbed control plots (1%). Linear regression showed that peatland species decreased in abundance with increasing depth of Polytrichum cushions. Conclusion The low soil moisture level in the restored areas is most likely limiting the establishment of Sphagnum mosses, considered as key species of the typical peatland environment. Thus, the restoration method studied here must be improved to increase the soil moisture by raising the water table or reducing drainage. This should be done through reducing storage time of the peat before redistribution, and minimizing slopes and heterogeneity of the microtopography of the restored area.","2017","2025-01-08 20:46:43","2025-03-12 01:48:50","","631-640","","4","20","","Applied Vegetation Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.8","3","SC: 0000016","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines whether adding stockpiled living peat material for 1-2 years can be spread and used to restore surface disturbed peatlands.

Their inconsistent recovery has led to Alberta's forests being highly fragmented, resulting in the need for seismic line restoration programs and subsequent monitoring. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is becoming an increasingly popular technology for the fast and accurate measurement of forests. Mobile LiDAR scanners (MLS) are emerging as an alternative to traditional aerial LiDAR due to their increased point cloud density. To determine whether MLS could be effective for collecting vegetation data on seismic lines, we sampled 17 seismic lines using the Emesent Hovermap (TM) in leaf-on and leaf-off conditions. Processing the LiDAR data was conducted with GreenValley International's LiDAR 360 software, and data derived from the point clouds were compared to physically measured field data. Overall, the tree detection algorithm was unsuccessful at accurately segmenting the point clouds. Complex vegetation environments on seismic lines, including small conifers with obscured stems or extremely dense and tall shrubs with overlapping canopies, posed a challenge for the software's capacity to differentiate trees As a result, tree densities and diameters were overestimated, while tree heights were underestimated. Exploration of alternative algorithms and software is needed if measuring vegetation data on seismic lines with MLS is to be implemented.","2022-11","2025-01-08 20:46:43","2025-03-12 18:17:29","","","","11","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.9","2","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of remote sensing using mobile LiDAR to monitor the restoration of forests impacted by seismic lines.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; on-site restoration; seismic lines; vegetation; remote sensing; monitoring; LiDAR; mitigation hierarchy; mineral exploration; vegetation disturbance; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A long-term research program investigating site-specific and cost-effective methods for rehabilitating degraded lands for fish and wildlife habitat has developed six general strategies that are applicable to the range of disturbed conditions. These strategies include 1) flooding of gravel mine sites for fish habitat, 2) creation of wetlands in ponds perched on overburden stockpiles, 3) revegetation of thick gravel fill and overburden to compensate for lost wildlife habitat, 4) removal of gravel fill to help restore wet tundra habitats, 5) restoration of tundra on less severely modified habitats, and 6) remediation of areas contaminated by oil spills, seawater spills, and drilling mud.

To assess the biophysical factors affecting permafrost dynamics, we monitored permafrost and ecological conditions in central Alaska from 2005 to 2021 by measuring weather, land cover, topography, thaw depths, hydrology, soil properties, soil thermal regimes, and vegetation cover between burned (1990 fire) and unburned terrain. Climate data show large variations among years with occasional, extremely warm–wet summers and cold–snowless winters that affect permafrost stability. Microtopography and thaw depth surveys revealed both permafrost degradation and aggradation. Thaw depths were deeper in post-fire scrub compared to unburned black spruce and increased moderately during the last year, but analysis of historical imagery (1954–2019) revealed no increase in thermokarst rates due to fire. Recent permafrost formation was observed in older bogs due to an extremely cold–snowless winter in 2007. Soil sampling found peat extended to depths of 1.5–2.8 m with basal radiocarbon dates of ~5–7 ka bp, newly accumulating post-thermokarst peat, and evidence of repeated episodes of permafrost formation and degradation. Soil surface temperatures in post-fire scrub bogs were ~1 °C warmer than in undisturbed black spruce bogs, and thermokarst bogs and lakes were 3–5 °C warmer than black spruce bogs. Vegetation showed modest change after fire and large transformations after thermokarst. We conclude that extreme seasonal weather, ecological succession, fire, and a legacy of earlier geomorphic processes all affect the repeated formation and degradation of permafrost, and thus create a highly patchy mosaic of ecotypes resulting from widely varying ecological trajectories within boreal peatland ecosystems.","2022","2025-01-08 20:46:44","2025-03-07 18:27:33","","","","8","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.9","4","SC: 0000005","<p>- This paper examines the interacting effects of fire, vegetation, landscape position and climate extremes on permafrost depth in subarctic peatlands. </p>","","","fire; peatland; permafrost; permafrost thaw; vegetation; peat; soil temperature; substrate disturbance; microtopography; vegetation disturbance; substrate; physiography; climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All sites responded similarly to simulated drought: pore water pH declined significantly following the 30 day drought and the decline was greater following the 60 day drought treatment. The decline in pore water pH was due to increasing sulphate concentrations, whereas nitrate increased more in the 60 day drought treatment. Decreases in pH were accompanied by large increases in Ni and Co that greatly exceeded provincial water quality guidelines.

The discharge zone was transformed to a floating mat during the 30-year course of the project. Strong diurnal cycles in surface water temperatures were measured, with a median daily swing of about 6-10 C. Pumped water was a few degrees warmer than the wetland background, and was reduced in temperature by passage through the adaptation zone. The time constants for adaptation (63% of change) were approximately one-half to 1 day. Soil temperatures followed a cyclic pattern, with decreasing amplitude with depth, and a time delay increasing with depth. The seasonal surface maximum was about 18 C. The irrigation season started on May 1, with water at 10 C, and ended in early October, with water at 10 C. The soil conduction model was used to infer cyclic surface temperatures, with a smoothed result compared to synoptic temperature measurements in surface water. Background zone fitting parameters were the Julian day of surface maximum temperature (196), mean temperature (7.9 C), surface amplitude (10.3 C), and penetration depth (1.0 m). Soil heat fluxes were vertically downward during the warm season, and back up toward the surface with maxima of 1.4 MJ/m2 d in the discharge zone.

The plant community shift, from the initial sedge-willow and leatherleaf-bog birch cover types to a cattail-dominant cover type, progressed to a 83-ha area over the 30-year period of record (POR). The interior portion of this new cattail patch became a floating mat. There were large gradients in stem densities and stem heights within the impacted area. The response times of the vegetative community shifts were on the order of 10 years for 63% of the final impact zone development. The grow-in time for development of a new larger standing crop in the discharge zone was also 10 years. The impacted area was stable at the 30-year time, without any further moving fronts. Around the cattail zone, there were fringe areas that contained a mixture of the original cover types intruded by relatively small amounts of cattail. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We examined the response of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) across an experimental manipulation of water table position (both raised and lowered water table treatments) in a boreal-rich fen in interior Alaska. DOC and TDN responses to water table manipulation exhibited an interaction with seasonal ice dynamics. We observed consistently higher DOC and TDN concentrations in the lowered water table treatment (71.7 +/- 6.5 and 3.0 +/- 0.3 mg(-L)) than in both the control (55.6 +/- 5.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 mg(-L)) and raised (49.1 +/- 4.3 and 1.9 +/- 0.1 mg L-1, respectively) water table treatments. Across all plots, pore water DOC concentrations at 20 cm increased as the depth to water table increased (R-2 = 0.43, p < 0.001). DOC concentrations also increased as the seasonal thaw depth increased, with solutes increasing most rapidly in the drained plot (R-2 = 0.62, p < 0.001). About half of the TDN pool was composed of dissolved organic N (DON). Inorganic N and DON were both highly correlated with changes in DOC, and their respective constraints to mineralization are discussed. These results demonstrate that a declining water table position and dryer conditions affect thaw depth and peat temperatures, and interactions among these ecosystem properties will likely increase DOC and TDN loading and potential for export in these systems.","2010-10","2025-01-08 20:46:44","2025-03-07 18:21:18","","","","","115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.7","2","SC: 0000068","<p>- This paper examines the export of dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen as a result of experimental drainage and floodingof a peatland dominanted watershed in Alaska.</p>","","","biogeochemistry; hydrology; peatland; nutrients; flooding; drawdown; carbon cycle; dissolved organic carbon; surface water/runoff; cold climate; climate; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also examined the most important processes for the treatment wetlands as a long-term P sink and analysed peat and water quality in the peat soils of the wetland. We tested P adsorption capacity by comparing batch test results with peat P and pore water PO4-P concentrations. The results showed that P adsorption capacity in the treatment wetland did not change in a 12-year period according to batch testing but the maximum sorption capacity may have been reached, although P retention level remained high after almost 20 years of wetland use. Phosphorus accumulation through peat accretion as a long-term sink was only of minor importance for P retention (0.5-7%). The main retention mechanisms for P in runoff in the wetlands were found to be filtration, sedimentation and precipitation with metals. Iron (Fe) accumulation in the surface peat indicated that its origin was peat extraction runoff. Thus long-term P retention depends on the hydrogeological setting and the quality of the water, which depends on the source. Calculations based on inlet/outlet loads from treatment wetlands may not always provide a reliable estimate of long-term P retention due to occasional P release from Fe under anaerobic conditions. Therefore new sites or sites experiencing problems with P retention should be sampled to determine the balance between peat P content and pore water PO4-P concentration and the availability of metals for precipitation.

A study of cutover sites abandoned for 7-years (H92) and 2-years (H97), and an undisturbed section of the Lac Saint-Jean (LSJ) cutover bog was conducted to characterize peat volume changes and its associated hydrological behaviour. Shrinkage and compression accounted for 96-97% of seasonal volume change. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-S) varied linearly with peat compression; a I cm decrease in peat thickness causing a 5.2 cm d(-1) decrease in K-S at H92, and a 1.4 cm d(-1) decrease in K-S at H97. A 2-6% seasonal decrease in saturated volumetric moisture content (theta(S)) at the cutover sites was partly due to soil compression, although the development of CH4 bubbles possibly affected moisture content. In the unsaturated zone moisture retentivity (theta-Psi) was seasonally transient due to the shifting soil structure. The greater volumetric response to a change in water storage of the more porous and less decomposed peat at H97 indicates a long-term decreasing trend in peat compressibility due to irreversible losses in pore volume. Deterioration of high water storage and low water retention properties at H92 suggests that cutover sites abandoned for longer periods will become increasingly hostile to Sphagnum recolonization despite the blockage of drainage ditches.

Open-pit oil sands mining activities in Northern Alberta result in large-scale removal of the surficial landscape, which comprises many (nearly equal 50%) peatlands, approximately 90% of which are fens with a wide range of peat thicknesses (< 1 m to approximately 5 m). Recently, the concept of peatland creation was adapted into the regulatory framework. Two experimental fen peatlands have now been constructed on post-mining landscapes in order to test the design implications and implementation methods and to develop knowledge to advance the concept. These two systems were guided by different conceptual approaches: one utilized numerical modelling for landscape optimization, while the other attempted to mimic the landscape position of natural fen systems (and supported the design with numerical modelling). Both system designs attempt to accelerate succession by adding peat substrate (0.5 m and 2 m) and revegetating, with the belief that the system will stabilize within decades as opposed to millennia. This paper provides an overview of the feasibility of peatland creation, from a primarily hydrologic perspective, and addresses the complexity of determining whether these projects can be deemed a success. Future landscape design plans could benefit from a change of perception of the role of peatlands in the landscape. This change should involve a shift away from viewing wetlands as landforms constrained to low-lying areas within the reclaimed landscape, and towards recognizing that peatlands can function as both a sink and source of water to the remainder of the catchment. Wetland interconnectivity within the reconstructed landscape could increase water detention and storage during wet periods, which would benefit both the wetlands and the forestlands during dry periods. The assessment of the success of these constructed systems should be a reflection of our ability to correctly and accurately predict the influence of external forcings (e.g., climate) on the processes operating within a newly constructed system. Short timeframes ( approximately 5 years) are sufficient to characterize a range of processes operating in the constructed ecosystems; however, longer time periods will reduce uncertainty in the assessment of the system's successional pathway. The design of future constructed fen peatlands must employ an adaptive approach that assimilates the knowledge developed in the current research and the information attained over the longer-term to guide the design of future fen systems.","2016","2025-01-08 20:46:45","2025-03-13 13:32:12","","130-139","","","161","","Earth-Sci.

The hydrological regime of reclaimed landscapes will be a manifestation of the processes operating within the individual landforms that comprise it. Hydrology is the most important process regulating wetland function and development, via strong controls on chemical and biotic processes. Accordingly, this research addresses the growing and immediate need to understand the hydrological processes that operate within reconstructed landscapes following resource extraction. In this study, the function of a constructed fen watershed (the Nikanotee Fen watershed) is evaluated for the first two years following construction (2013–2014) and is assessed and discussed within the context of the construction-level design. The system design was capable of sustaining wet conditions within the Nikanotee Fen during the snow-free period in 2013 and 2014, with persistent ponded water in some areas. Evapotranspiration dominated the water fluxes from the system. These losses were partially offset by groundwater discharge from the upland aquifer, which demonstrated strong hydrologic connectivity with the fen in spite of most construction materials having lower than targeted saturated hydraulic conductivities. However, the variable surface infiltration rates and thick placement of a soil-capping layer constrained recharge to the upland aquifer, which remained below designed water contents in much of the upland. These findings indicate that it is possible to engineer the landscape to accommodate the hydrological functions of a fen peatland following surface oil sands extraction. Future research priorities should include understanding the storage and release of water within coarse-grained reclaimed landforms as well as evaluating the relative importance of external water sources and internal water conservation mechanisms for the viability of fen ecosystems over the longer-term. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2025-01-08 20:46:45","2025-03-14 16:44:44","","593-605","","","603-604","","Sci.

The spatial pattern of metal in peat forms a circular map pattern, centred on the smelter and skewed by the predominant wind direction. An empirical model fitted to the data provides an estimate of the rate of concentration decrease with radial distance, and the background metal level far away from the smelter. For Cu, Pb and Zn, the smelter-related anomaly is statistically indistinguishable from background levels at about 50 km from the smelter. Using approximate measurements of peat accumulation rate and bulk density of peat, the amount of metal in the smelter-centred anomaly was calculated by integration. The Cu anomaly can account for about 30% of reported emissions in the sampling year (1996-1997); the Pb and Zn anomalies account for about 10 and 26% of reported emissions, respectively. The discrepancy between the peat-derived metal anomaly and the reported emissions may be due in part to various sources of error and bias. The major causes, however, are probably long-range transport of atmospheric emissions, particularly during dry weather periods, and incomplete physical trapping and chemical fixation of metal in the peat hummocks.","2002","2025-01-08 20:46:45","2025-03-07 22:07:11","","99-110","","","2, Part 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper tests a method to monitor metal pollution from a smelter using sphagnum peat samples in surrounding peatlands.

Hence, following oil sands mining, landscape reclamation is a part of the mine closure process in order to return functioning ecosystems, including peatlands, to the region. This study was conducted at a pilot fen reclamation project and three other diverse natural (poor, rich and saline) fens in the oil sands region during the growing seasons of 2013 and 2014, the first and second year post-construction. Ecosystem functioning of the constructed fen (CF) was evaluated with reference to natural fens based on pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and chemistry. Significant variation of DOC concentration among the reference fens was observed, varying from an average of 42.0 mg/L at the rich fen (RF) to 70.8 mg/L at the saline fen (SF). Dissolved organic carbon concentration at CF was significantly lower than at all reference fens, but increased significantly over the first two years. Seasonal variation of DOC concentration was also observed in each site with concentration increasing over the growing season. At CF, DOC was comprised of larger, more humic and complex aromatic compounds than reference fens in the first year post-construction based on its spectrophotometric properties; however, these differences were reduced in the second year. Initial DOC concentration and chemistry at CF was indicative of the source being largely the peat placed during fen construction. Changes in chemistry and increasing concentration of DOC in the second growing season likely resulted from increasing inputs from plants established on site. These results suggest that DOC concentration is likely to increase in future at CF as vascular plant productivity increases and in response to salinity sourced from tailing sand used to construct the catchment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","2016","2025-01-08 20:46:45","2025-03-08 14:23:51","","579-589","","","557-558","","Sci.

The need for cost-effective active and passive mine water treatment methods has also increased. Natural peatlands are commonly used as a final step for treatment of mining influenced water. However, their permanent retention of harmful substances is affected by influent concentrations and environmental conditions. The effects of dilution, pH, temperature, oxygen availability, and contaminant accumulation on retention and leaching of As, Sb, Ni, and sulfate from mine process water and drainage water obtained from treatment peatlands in Finnish Lapland were studied in batch sorption experiments, and discussed in context of field data and environmental impacts. The results, while demonstrating effectiveness of peat to remove the target contaminants from mine water, revealed the risk of leaching of As, Sb, and SO42- from treatment peatlands when diluted mine water was introduced. Sb was more readily leached compared to As while leaching of both was supported by higher pH of 9. No straightforward effect of temperature and oxygen availability in controlling removal and leaching was evident from the results. The results also showed that contaminant accumulation in treatment peatlands after long-term use can lead to decreased removal and escalated leaching of contaminants, with the effect being more pronounced for As and Ni.

However, while other metalloids such as arsenic have been well studied, little is known about removal and retention of Sb in northern wetlands under challenging environmental conditions. In this study we assessed short-term, long-term and seasonal variations in mobility, removal, and retention of Sb from mining-influenced water in two peat based natural wetlands with different loading and physical conditions. Analyses based on 10 years of water quality data and data on contaminant accumulation in the peat soil revealed that the wetland with significantly lower hydraulic load and Sb areal load achieved adequate Sb removal, but with a slight decline in recent years. Antimony concentrations at the wetland outlet were slightly lower in summers than in winters. Dilution due to high rainfall during summer may be the likely reason for low outlet concentrations towards the end of summer. Outlet Sb concentrations were on the rise after inlet water quality was significantly improved through enhanced pre-treatment indicating mobilization of accumulated Sb. In comparison, the smaller wetland with higher hydraulic and Sb loading had very low Sb removal and a stronger decrease in Sb concentration through dilution due to snowmelt. The results highlight the challenges in Sb retention which should get more attention when treatment wetlands are designed for Sb rich waters such as mine waters and there are changes in water treatment arrangement in specific cases.","2020-04","2025-01-08 20:46:46","2025-03-07 22:08:30","","","","","148","","Ecol.

In Central Europe, many re-wetting projects have been implemented to restore wetlands for multifunctional purposes during the last years. The Pohnsdorfer Stauung (Northern Germany) is a eutrophic fen which was used for intensive agriculture for 40 years. The peatland is divided in two subareas by a small stream. In the scope of re-wetting measures, one subarea (westpolder) was flooded by blockading the main drainage ditch in 1996/97, a second subarea (eastpolder) was re-connected to the stream by an inlet and outlet in 2001. Nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics were investigated in the surface water of these systems over a 5-year (westpolder) and 3-year (eastpolder) period, and balances were calculated. In both polders high dynamics of nitrogen and phosphate concentrations were observed in the surface water. Nitrate peaked in the winter months, whereas ammonium, phosphate and organically bound nitrogen (No,,) revealed highest values during summer. Daily balances for the eastpolder and annual balances for both polders were calculated. In both polders nitrate was retained but phosphate and N-org were exported. Differences of the nutrient dynamics and the absolute and relative balances between the polders were due to the different hydrology: the eastpolder received a high nitrate load by the stream, in the westpolder nutrient loads are low and internal nutrient cycles are dominating. During the summer months, high ammonium concentrations, oxygen depletion, and phosphate release occur in the warm, stagnant water of both polders. Normally, high phosphate and ammonium concentrations did not coincided with discharge phases from the polders. However, in August 2002 after heavy rainfall high phosphorus and ammonium discharge was observed. One important factor influencing the detected nutrient dynamics and balances is the change from a drained and fertilized peatland to a flooded wetland in only a few years. We conclude that continuous water flow and stable water levels are desired for flooded peatlands to prevent high concentrations of ammonium and phosphate and to utilize the potential for nitrate retention. In degenerated peatlands, flooding should only be regarded as an easy technological solution in order to conserve the peat mineralization, and to form the foundation for the further development of the peatland to a more efficient nutrient retaining system.

To establish the effect of flooding on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) production, we incubated six sample types of boreal forest and peatland soils and litters for 15 weeks under flooded (anoxic and suboxic) and non-flooded (oxic) conditions at three temperatures (4, 12, and 22 °C). Water was sampled at 3-week intervals and analyzed for DOC and TDN concentration. Cumulative DOC and TDN production ranged widely: from 4.4 to 146.2 mg C g−1 C for DOC and 4.4 to 112.2 mg N g−1 N for TDN under flooded conditions, and from 1.3 to 16.6 mg C g−1 C for DOC and 0.7 to 8.5 mg N g−1 N for TDN under non-flooded conditions. Cumulative DOC and TDN production was greater under flooded than non-flooded conditions for all sample types with flooded:non-flooded ratios averaging 10.6 for DOC and 9.5 for TDN. Within the flooded treatments, anoxic conditions produced more cumulative DOC and TDN than suboxic conditions, with average anoxic:suboxic ratios of 1.3 and 5.8 for DOC and TDN, respectively. Raising temperatures increased cumulative DOC and TDN production marginally under both flooded and non-flooded conditions as the average ratios for 22:12 and 12:4 °C were 1.1 for DOC and 1.2 for TDN. Generally, more DOC and TDN were released from litters than soils under both the flooded and non-flooded incubations, with litter:soil ratios averaging 8.5 for DOC and 2.1 for TDN. DOC:TDN ratio was generally higher in the solutions than in the original sample, particularly in the litters. This study thus indicated that DOC and TDN production was largely affected by flooding regime, O2 concentration, and substrate characteristics and less affected by temperature.","2014-04-01","2025-01-08 20:46:46","2025-03-07 18:21:18","","35-48","","1","118","","Biogeochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","2","SC: 0000046","<p>- This paper examines the effect of flooding of peatland soils on the export of DOC and nitrogen from peat columns. </p>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; hydrology; peatland; peat; nutrients; water table; flooding; carbon cycle; dissolved organic carbon; substrate; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examines interactions between microbial communities, peat chemistry, moisture content, and temperature in the context of degrading palsa fields in the vast (372,000 km(2)), carbon rich, and rapidly warming permafrost peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowlands. The temperature sensitivities of microbial GHG production and consumption from palsa and fen peat were assessed, and microbial community structure was examined as a potential constraint on GHG production in relation to changes in peat chemistry associated with thermokarst encroachment and active layer deepening. High CH4 production was observed from thermokarst peat, under controlled moisture and temperature conditions, associated with increased pH. A shift in methanogen taxonomic and metabolic diversity favoring aceticlastic methanogenesis was associated with changes in peat chemistry and pH from palsa to thermokarst fen peat. In palsa peat, CH4 production rates were lowest but most sensitive to temperature variations, due to recalcitrant carbon compounds. CH4 production was highly sensitive to increased temperatures, yet was balanced by high temperature sensitivity of CH4 oxidation in oxic conditions, consistent with the low temperature sensitivity of fluxes observed in field studies from other permafrost peatlands. Building on the microbial controls in this study, future work should explore how permafrost degradation and increased hydrological connectivity to mineral substrates are changing in this globally significant permafrost peatland, and how this impacts net CH4 emissions.","2021-06","2025-01-08 20:46:46","2025-03-07 18:27:29","","","","6","35","","Global Biogeochem.

In the present study, seasonal As mobilization was observed in an acidic, minerotrophic peatland (called Lehstenbach) in late summer, accompanied by a peak in dissolved sulfide (S(-II)). Arsenic speciation revealed the lowest seasonal porewater concentrations of arsenite and arsenate, likely due to As(III)-S-bridging to natural organic matter. Arsenic mobilization was driven by the formation of arsenite-S(-II) colloids and formation of methylthiolated arsenates (up to 59% of the sum of As species) and to a minor extent also of inorganic thioarsenates (6%–30%) and oxymethylated arsenates (5%–24%). Sorption experiments using a purified model peat, the Lehstenbach peat, natural (to mimic winter conditions) and reacted with S(-II) (to mimic late summer conditions) at acidic and neutral pH confirmed low sorption of methylthiolated arsenates. At acidic pH and in the presence of S(-II), oxymethylated arsenates were completely thiolated. This methylthiolation decreased As sorption up to 10 and 20 times compared with oxymethylated arsenates and arsenite, respectively. At neutral pH, thiolation of monomethylated arsenates was incomplete, and As could be partially retained as oxymethylated arsenates. Dimethylated arsenate was still fully thiolated and highly mobile. Misidentification of methylthiolated arsenates as oxymethylated arsenates might explain previous contradictory reports of methylation decreasing or increasing As mobility.","2024-01-23","2025-01-08 20:46:46","2025-03-07 18:21:45","","1669-1679","","3","58","","Environ.

This may result in increasing fire frequency or severity in peatlands, which could cause these ecosystems to shift from a net sink of carbon (C) to a net source of C to the atmosphere. Similar to C cycling, peatlands serve as a net sink for mercury (Hg), which binds strongly to organic matter and accumulates in peat over time. This stored Hg is also susceptible to re-release to the atmosphere during peat fires. Here we investigate the physical properties that influence depth of burn in experimental peat columns and the resulting emissions of CO, CO2, CH4, and gaseous and particulate Hg. As expected, bulk density and soil moisture content were important controls on depth of burn, CO2 emissions, and CO emissions. However, our results show that CH4 and Hg emissions are insensitive to combustion temperature or fuel moisture content. Emissions during the burning of peat, across a wide range of moisture conditions, were associated with low particulate Hg and high gaseous Hg release. Due to strong correlations between total Hg and CO emissions and because high Hg emissions occurred despite incomplete combustion of total C, our results suggest that Hg release during peat burning is governed by the thermodynamics of Hg reduction more so than by the release of Hg associated with peat combustion. Our measured emissions ratios, particularly for CH4:CO2, are higher than values typically used in the upscaling of boreal forest or peatland fire emissions. These emission ratios have important implications not only for our understanding of smouldering chemistry, but also for potential influences of peat fires on the Earth's climate system.","2018","2025-01-08 20:46:46","2025-02-10 13:48:15","","","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines carbon and mercury emissions during the burning of peat in peatlands. &nbsp;Peat fires caused low particulate Hg and high gaseous Hg release, across a wide range of moisture conditions.</p> </div>","","","Canada; cumulative effects; fire; peatland; peat; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; smouldering; metal/metalloid; substrate; fertility change/contamination; mercury/methylmercury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To make informed conservation decisions, it is essential to consider the full range of ecosystem-level threats associated with artificially lowered water levels. This becomes particularly challenging when dealing with diffuse and indirect impacts, such as ombrotrophic bogs near underground mining activities that extract groundwater. In this study, we monitored water tables using automatic pressure loggers over an 11-year period in a protected hemiboreal bog and in drained peatland surrounding it in northeastern Estonia. The bog is located within the groundwater cone of depression caused by an adjacent oil-shale mine, approximately 60–70 m deep. By comparing monitoring points along the bog-drained forest gradient and analysing time series data, we were able to distinguish the influences of climate and mining activities on water levels in the bog. Our findings indicate that mining activities have clear effects on deeper bedrock aquifers and the bog itself, exacerbating the impacts of recent drought events. The dynamics of the hydraulic heads at different monitoring points reveal local infiltration ‘windows’ within the bog, likely resulting from underlying fracture zones in the bedrock. Considering the escalating intensity of climate change, mires' vulnerability to these combined impacts is expected to increase. Therefore, adopting a precautionary and forward-thinking conservation strategy is crucial when addressing ongoing or future drainage and mining activities near protected wetlands. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2023","2025-01-08 20:46:47","2025-03-12 01:55:16","","","","8","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.6","3","SC: 0000003","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the drawdown in an ombrotrophic peatland (bog) by the drawdown of the water table as a result of underground mining nearby.</p> </div>","","","climate change; hydrology; peatland; mining; groundwater; water table; drawdown; hydrological alteration; drought","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence exists of a recent increase in Sphagnum over fens that can alter ecosystem functions. Contrast between flarks and Sphagnum moss cover may enable remote sensing of these changes with satellite proxies. We explored recent changes in hydro-morphological patterns and vegetation in a south-boreal aapa mire in Finland and tested the performance of Landsat bands and indices in detecting Sphagnum increase in aapa mires. We combined aerial image analysis and vegetation survey, repeated after 60 years, to support Landsat satellite image analysis. Aerial image analysis revealed a decrease in flark area by 46% between 1947 and 2019. Repeated survey showed increase in Sphagnum mosses (S. pulchrum, S. papillosum) and deep-rooted vascular plants (Menyanthes trifoliata, Carex rostrata). A supervised classification of high-resolution UAV image recognized the legacy of infilled flarks in the patterning of Sphagnum carpets. Among Landsat variables, all separate spectral bands, the Green Difference Vegetation Index (GDVI), and the Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) correlated with the flark area. Between 1985 and 2020, near-infrared (NIR) and GDVI increased in the central flark area, and AWEI decreased throughout the mire area. In aapa mire complexes, flark fen and Sphagnum bog zones have contrasting Landsat NIR reflectance, and NIR band is suggested for monitoring changes in flarks. The observed increase in Sphagnum mosses supports the interpretation of ongoing fen–bog transitions in Northern European aapa mires, indicating significant ecosystem-scale changes.","2022-08-01","2025-01-08 20:46:47","2025-03-12 18:17:44","","1166-1188","","5","25","","Ecosystems","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.7","2","SC: 0000046","<p>- This paper examines how remote sensing from satellite data can detect differences in sphagnum cover between string fens and bog margins.</p>","","","hydrology; peatland; vegetation; bog; water table; remote sensing; satellite imagery; monitoring; unmanned aerial vehicle; fen; vegetation sampling; vegetation disturbance; string fen / aapa mire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What to do with the peatlands after the peat mining has stopped is a question for restoration ecologists and to leave a disturbed site to spontaneous regeneration could be one option. The main question of our study was whether it is an effective means of restoration and under which circumstances. Spontaneous succession was studied in 11 industrially mined peatlands, which encompassed successional stages of different age. Vegetation samples (109), 5. m. ×. 5. m in size, were recorded in the stages using visual estimation of percentage cover of all present vascular plants. The age, abiotic environmental characteristics (position of water table, water pH, and substratum chemistry), as well as biotic characteristics (proportion of land cover categories up to 100. m, 300. m and 1. km from each sample, and the distance to the nearest undisturbed peatland vegetation) were assessed for each sampled successional stage. Other characteristics were related to the whole localities (altitude, average annual temperature, and precipitation). The data were analyzed by multivariate statistics. The environmental variables, except K-content and land cover up to 100. m, exhibited some significant effects on the vegetation patterns. External, i.e., landscape factors, had together a larger effect on the course of succession than abiotic site factors. The most important particular factors included ground water level, substrate pH, and presence of undisturbed peatland vegetation in the surroundings. Also important was geographic location predominantly reflecting site altitude. Spontaneous recovery of the peatland vegetation was more successful on those sites where the water table was intentionally increased. The increase of the water table after peat extraction and preservation of the original undisturbed peatland vegetation in the area neighbouring a mined site during the process of peat extraction are recommended to promote spontaneous recovery of the peatlands.","2014","2025-01-08 20:46:47","2025-03-12 01:48:51","","38-45","","","69","","Ecol.

The aim of our work was to assess such impacts on the ecological functions of oil-contaminated soils in West Siberia of Russia. The total petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) content in contaminated soils varied between 3.7 and 390 g kg−1. Although peat had the ability to absorb some PHC, excess oil migrated in soil both downward and laterally. Catalase activity, soil respiration activity (basal respiration [BR], microbial biomass carbon [Cmic], and specific respiration activity [qCO2]), and Enchytraeus albidus survival and reproduction rates showed significant negative correlations with PHC concentrations, and thus they can be used as guides for establishing acceptable PHC limits in peat soils. Based on the Logit model, the concentration of PHC in peat soil that corresponds to ∼20% reduction on functions (worm reproduction, catalase activity, and basal respiration) is about 40–50 g kg−1. The concentrations of PHC that will result in 80% functional reductions (i.e., near-complete loss on functional activities) are worm production (177 g kg−1), catalase activity (123 g kg−1), and basal respiration (311 g kg−1).

Arsenic-metabolizing microorganisms were abundant in peat soil from both TPs (up to 108 cells gdw−1), with arsenate respirers being about 100 times more abundant than arsenite oxidizers. In uninhibited microcosm incubations, supplemented arsenite was oxidized under oxic conditions and supplemented arsenate was reduced under anoxic conditions, while little to no oxidation/reduction was observed in NaN3-inhibited microcosms, indicating high As-turnover potential of peat microbes. Formation of thioarsenates was observed in anoxic microcosms. Sequencing of the functional genemarkers aioA (arsenite oxidizers), arrA (arsenate respirers) and arsC (detoxifying arsenate reducers) demonstrated high diversity of the As-metabolizing microbial community. The microbial community composition differed between the two TPs, which may have affected As removal efficiencies. In the present situation, arsenate reduction is likely the dominant net process and contributes substantially to As removal.

This study compared N removal efficiency of six constructed wetlands (CWs) treating mine waters and three CWs polishing municipal wastewater. There were clear impacts of point source N loading to recipient water bodies in all cases studied and >300-fold increase in N was seen in some cases. First-order N removal coefficient was determined for seven of these CWs. All CWs studied were observed to remove N efficiently during the warm growing season but the amount of N released increased significantly during the cold season. Although some year-round purification was achieved by both peat-based and pond-type CWs, removal of nitrate + nitrite-N((NO3- + NO2-)-N) was low during winter. The first-order N removal coefficient varied from 4.9 . 10(-6) to 1.9 . 10(-3) d(-1) and showed that peat-based CWs were slightly more efficient in N removal than pond-type CWs. However, purification efficiency was steadier and higher for pond-type CWs, as lower hydraulic load or longer water residence time compensated for purification performance. Pond-type CWs showed mean removal efficiency of 59% and 46% for ammonium-N (NH4+-N) and (NO3- + NO2-)-N, respectively, whereas peatland-type CWs had lower removal efficiency for NH4+-N (mean of 26%) and in many cases negative removal for (NO3- + NO2-)-N. Correlation analysis revealed no clear, systematic relationship between temperature and N removal. However, in some CWs the highest correlation was between temperature and (NO3- + NO2-)-N, reflecting lower denitrification rate at lower temperature. More than 50% removal was found to require a hydraulic load below 10 mm d(-1). In order to achieve 70% of NH4+-N removal, N-tot load lower than 75 g m(-2) year(-1) and a residence time longer than 80 d are needed in CWs in cold-climate regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the exact mechanisms behind this removal are not well resolved. Thus, the present study combines results from microcosm experiments and pilot-scale TPs on the effects of microbes, temperature, and carbon substrate to elucidate the role of peat microorganisms in As and Sb removal. The main As and Sb species in TP inflow water are arsenate and antimonate. In peat microcosms, they were quantitatively reduced, however, at rates about 20–400 times lower than previously reported from pure cultures, likely due to excess of other terminal electron acceptors, such as nitrate and sulfate. Addition of the microbial inhibitor sodium azide inhibited reduction, indicating that it is indeed microbially mediated. Arsenite and antimonite (re)oxidation, which is in situ likely limited to upper, oxic peat layers, was likewise observed in peat microcosms. Only for antimonite, oxidation also occurred abiotically, likely catalyzed by humic acids or metals. Process rates increased with increasing temperature, but all processes occurred also at low temperatures. Monitoring of pilot-scale TPs revealed only minor effects of winter conditions (i.e., low temperature and freezing) on arsenic and antimony removal. Formation of methylated oxyarsenates was observed to increase As mobility at the onset of freezing. From different carbon substrates tested, lactate slightly enhanced arsenate reduction and antimonate reduction was stimulated by acetate, lactate, and formate. However, a maximum rate enhancement of only 1.8 times indicates that carbon substrate availability is not the rate-limiting factor in microbial arsenate or antimonate reduction. The collective data indicate that microorganisms catalyze reduction and (re)oxidation of As and Sb species in the TPs, and even though temperature is a major factor controlling microbial As and Sb reduction/(re)oxidation, low inflow concentrations, long water residence times, and the presence of unfrozen peat in lower layers allow for efficient removal also under winter conditions. © 2022 The Authors","2022","2025-01-08 20:46:47","2025-03-07 22:08:30","","","","","167","","Soil Biol.

In Northern climate, microorganisms in treatment peatlands (TPs) are affected by long and cold winters, but studies about those microorganisms are scarce. Thus, the bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities along gradients of mine water influence in two TPs were investigated. The TPs receive waters rich in contaminants, including arsenic (As), sulfate (SO42−) and nitrate (NO3−). Microbial diversity was high in both TPs, and microbial community composition differed between the studied TPs. Bacterial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria, archaeal communities were dominated by Methanomicrobia and the Candidate phylum Bathyarchaeota, and fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota (Leotiomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes). The functional potential of the bacterial and archaeal communities in TPs was predicted using PICRUSt. Sampling points affected by high concentrations of As showed higher relative abundance of predicted functions related to As resistance. Functions potentially involved in nitrogen and SO42− turnover in TPs were predicted for both TPs. The results obtained in this study indicate that (i) diverse microbial communities exist in Northern TPs, (ii) the functional potential of the peatland microorganisms is beneficial for contaminant removal in TPs and (iii) microorganisms in TPs are likely well-adapted to high contaminant concentrations as well as to the Northern climate.","2018","2025-01-08 20:46:48","2025-03-07 22:08:29","","","","10","94","","FEMS Microbiol.

Thus, input of high concentrations of those compounds as a result of anthropogenic activity pose a huge challenge to peatland ecosystems. At a mine site in Finnish Lapland, mining-affected waters are purified in two treatment peatlands (TPs) before they are released into downstream waters. The TPs experience long winters and are snow- and partly ice-covered from October to May. Contaminants in inflow waters include nitrogen compounds, sulfate, metals and metalloids. The TPs were intensively monitored for >10 years, and monitoring data was complemented with laboratory experiments. High levels of multiple contaminants, often in the mM range, were measured in TP inflow. Removal of some contaminants such as nitrogen compounds and sulfate was higher in summer months while removal of other contaminants such as arsenic and antimony was similar throughout the year. Potential process rates as assessed in laboratory incubations were generally higher at higher incubation temperatures and decreased with decreasing temperatures, but processes still occurred at 0 °C. The composition of the potentially active microbial community as assessed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing varied more strongly between the two TPs and the two layers, while seasonal variability was minor. Potentially active microorganisms included genera known for nitrification, denitrification, sulfate reduction, iron reduction as well as arsenate and antimonate reduction. The collective results indicate that (i) microbial communities in mining-affected peatlands were exposed to high concentrations of multiple contaminants, (ii) microbially mediated processes contributed to contaminant removal throughout the year, and (iii) differences in process rates and contaminant removal likely stem from overall lower activities rather than from changes in microbial community composition. © 2023","2024","2025-01-08 20:46:48","2025-03-07 22:08:27","","","","","189","","Soil Biol.

Few studies have assessed restoration practices on forest roads, yet they are the main linear disturbance throughout most circumboreal forests. In boreal forests of eastern Canada, such knowledge would be especially valuable for the conservation of boreal populations of woodland caribou (<i>Rangifer tarandus caribou</i>). We assessed the short-term establishment of vegetation following four treatments applied across 40 km of forest roads, along a restoration gradient involving additive treatments (i.e. each successive treatment included the treatments prior): closing the road to traffic, decompacting the soil, planting black spruce trees, and adding enriched soil. We linked lateral cover (a proxy of movement obstruction for wildlife) and the occurrence and abundance of plant species to road treatments and environmental covariates. Vegetation establishment 3-4 years after decommissioning was mostly influenced by treatments but also by road width and stand composition in the vicinity of roads. The combination of closing, decompacting, and planting was the most effective treatment to establish regeneration that would lead to suitable caribou habitat as it reduced food availability for moose and bears (i.e. lower presence of herbaceous species, fruit-bearing shrubs, and deciduous trees). It also reduced the presence of plants competing with spruce, such as ericaceous shrubs. Our results suggest that the decommissioning of forest roads could benefit caribou, provided it is performed at a sufficiently broad scale, and accompanied by other habitat restoration and protection practices.","2021-09","2025-01-08 20:46:48","2025-03-12 01:42:47","","","","7","29","","Restor.

The C pool in peat is a result of a relatively small imbalance between production and decay. High water levels and the consequent anoxia are considered the major causes for the imbalance. As such, the C sink of a peatland is labile, and sensitive to disturbances in environmental conditions. Changes in peatland ecosystem functions may be mediated through land-use change, and/or climatic warming. In both cases, lowering of the water level may be the key factor. Logically, lowered water levels with the consequent increase in oxygen availability in the surface soil may be assumed to result in accelerated rates of organic matter decomposition. Yet, earlier research has given highly contrasting results concerning the effects of lowered water levels on the rates of decomposition and the C sink/source behaviour of peatlands. The mechanisms controlling this variation remain unresolved. This paper summarizes the changes observed in the biotic and abiotic controls of decomposition following natural or artificial lowering of peatland water levels and show that they are complex and their interactions have not been previously explored. Long-term changes in the C cycle may differ from short-term changes. Short-term changes represent a disturbance in the ecosystem adapted to the pre-water-level-lowering conditions, while long-term changes result from several adaptive mechanisms of the ecosystem to the new hydrological regime. While in a short term, the disturbed system will always lose C, the long-term changes inherently vary among peatland types, climates, and extents of change in the water level. The paper closes by identifying the gaps in our knowledge that need to be addressed when proceeding towards a causal and unifying explanation for the C sink/source behaviour of peatlands following persistent lowering of the water level.","2006-08-01","2025-01-08 20:46:48","2025-03-07 18:21:41","","2011-2024","","8","38","","Soil Biol.

The effect of water level drawdown after drainage of mires for forestry was studied by comparing the vegetation on undrained pine-mire sites with that of sites drained 3-55 years earlier. The plant communities were analysed with respect to the following environmental variables: drainage age, total nutrient contents of surface peat, and tree stand characteristics. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to relate the environmental variables to data on the botanical composition of vegetation. 2. Two main gradients were found in the data. The first ordination axis clearly relates to a gradient in forest vegetation succession and the second axis to a gradient in peat nutrient level and pH. 3. The secondary succession towards forest vegetation started soon after drainage and proceeded most rapidly in the most nutrient-rich site types. This led to a more uniform vegetation composition between the site types. 4. Original mire species reacted differently to the changing post-drainage environment. Tall sedges (Carex lasiocarpa, C. rostrata) disappeared soon after drainage. The coverages of the mire dwarf shrubs gradually decreased with increasing tree stand volumes; Betula nana appears to have been the most sensitive species. The coverages of the Sphagna studied appear to have decreased in response to increasing tree stand shading in the order: S. fuscum gt S. recurvum complex gt S. magellanicum gt S. russowii. 5. The development towards forest vegetation on mires may diminish the regional (gamma-) diversity on forest-dominated landscapes, even if the species (alpha-) diversity on individual sites is little affected. 6. Long-term vegetation changes after artificial water level drawdown, emphasized in this study, can be used to mimic the effects on the predicted global climatic warming on mire vegetation.","1995","2025-01-08 20:46:48","2025-03-13 13:41:10","","785-802","","4","32","","J.

Few studies have been conducted to investigate aquifer-peatland connections, because flow connections are difficult to measure and can be spatially and temporally variable. The objective of this study was to combine chemical and botanical indicators of groundwater inflow to Sphagnum-dominated peatlands for a better classification of their water sources. Available knowledge of peatland geomorphic setting, water chemistry, and vegetation data for 12 aquifer-peatland systems of the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region and of the St. Lawrence Lowlands, two contrasting regions of southern Quebec (Canada), were used to derive indicators of groundwater inflow. Total dissolved solids (TDS) is identified as a comprehensive indicator of water mineralization. Threshold values of 16 mg/l (Abitibi-Temiscamingue) and 22 mg/l (St. Lawrence Lowlands) were found to indicate the presence of groundwater within the peatland. Results show that combining chemical (TDS) and botanical indicators can detect the presence of groundwater inflow into most of the studied peatlands. The indicators are more efficient on slope peatlands, where groundwater inflow is more substantial and less spatially variable, than in basin peatlands. A two-step approach is proposed: (1) identify the geomorphic setting of the peatland, and (2) estimate the chemical and botanical indicators. This approach is low-cost and easy to implement, and thus can be used on a large number of sites to assess the presence of groundwater inflow to peatlands.","2016","2025-01-08 20:46:49","2025-03-07 18:21:18","","142-151","","","64","","Ecol.

Because of the extremely low relief and presence of marine sediments, horizontal runoff and vertical seepages losses are minimal. As a consequence of this aquifer dewatering must occur to keep the open-pit mine dry. What is unknown is how the aquifer dewatering would impact the water balance of a peatland-dominated watershed. This study examines 3 years of aquifer dewatering from 2009 to 2011. New hydrological insights Deep seepage (groundwater recharge) varied with marine sediment thickness and represented a significant loss to the local system. Large downward fluxes were also measured in fen systems that are typically local discharge zones. Evaporation rates were also found to be lower in the bogs and fens and where impacted by lower water tables. When evaluating the water balance, with only 14.5% of the watershed impacted by the mine, the hydrological function of the entire watershed is more driven by seasonal climate variations than mine dewatering.","2015-09-01","2025-01-08 20:46:49","2025-03-07 21:59:20","","732-747","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>- This studies examines the impact of mine dewatering for an open pit on the hydrology and water table of peatlands in the Hudson Bay Lowland.</p>","","","Canada; Ontario; climate change; hydrology; peatland; mining; bog; water table; drawdown; open pit mine; fen; Hudson Bay Lowland; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we explore whether remote sensing can be used to monitor peatland resilience to drought. We take resilience to mean the rate at which a system recovers from perturbation; here measured literally as a recovery timescale of a soil surface moisture proxy from drought lowering. Our objectives were (1) to assess the reliability of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter as a proxy for water table depth (WTD); (2) to develop a method using SAR to estimate below-ground (hydrological) resilience of peatlands; and (3) to apply the developed method to different sites and consider the links between resilience and land management. Our inferences of WTD from Sentinel-1 SAR data gave results with an average Pearson's correlation of 0.77 when compared to measured WTD values. The 2018 summer drought was used to assess resilience across three different UK peatland areas (Dartmoor, the Peak District, and the Flow Country) by considering the timescale of the soil moisture proxy recovery. Results show clear areas of lower resilience within all three study sites, which often correspond to areas of high drainage and may be particularly vulnerable to increasing drought severity/events under climate change. This method is applicable to monitoring peatland resilience elsewhere over larger scales, and could be used to target restoration work towards the most vulnerable areas.","2021","2025-01-08 20:46:49","2025-03-12 01:55:17","","","","","761","","Sci.

Active restoration is often required to return degraded peatlands to a net carbon sink. The peat-block restoration technique, where intact peat blocks are extracted from a donor peatland and transferred to restore peatlands where the remnant peat is non-existent, contaminated, and/or undergoes seasonal flooding is increasingly being adopted as a peatland restoration technique given the carbon sequestration that can occur immediately post-restoration. However, donor peat blocks often need to be temporarily stockpiled during the restoration process due to logistical constraints. The dewatering of the peat blocks during this stockpiling period may alter hydrophysical peat properties that sustain critical peatland ecohydrological functionality and ultimately affect peatland restoration success. Yet, the hydrophysical evolution of stockpiled peat blocks remains unknown. Here, we examine how peat block stockpiling time (3, 7, 11, and 14 months and a reference site) impacts peat hydrophysical properties and sphagnum moss photosynthesis, both of which are critical for peatland restoration success. Stockpiling peat differentially impacted the hydrophysical properties between the shallower and deeper peats, where little to no impact from stockpiling was observed in the shallower peats, regardless of stockpiling time. Rather, as stockpiling time increased, there was a marked decrease in macroporosity (pores >75 mu m) and mobile porosity (drainable porosity at approximately -100 hpa) at depths below 20 cm but the water conducting matrix porosity (defined as mobile porosity minus macroporosity) was not significantly different than the reference samples. However, stockpiling created inhospitable conditions for sphagnum mosses., as chlorophyll fluorescence ratio was below 0.3, indicating little to no photosynthesis of the stockpiled peat during summertime drought conditions. Taken together, we suggest limiting stockpiling time as much as possible would be advantageous for using the stockpiled peat blocks for the peat-block restoration technique or other restoration efforts, such as floating mat creation.","2022-09","2025-01-08 20:46:49","2025-03-07 22:07:54","","","","","182","","Ecol.

To assess potential recovery, we sampled six sites that ranged in time since thinning from a few months to 15 years. Soil disturbance directly decreased moss biomass and led to an increase in sedge cover and a decrease in root production. Moreover, soil CO2 production potential, and soil CO2 and CH4 concentrations were greater in recently disturbed areas than in the control areas. In contrast, CO2 and CH4 emissions, microbial biomass and structure, and the decomposition rate of cellulose appeared to be uncoupled and did not show signs of impact.

To address this, we collected soil samples from six peatland sites that were thinned using a harvester–forwarder combination. Peat samples were taken from the trails formed by the machinery and outside the trails to a depth of 10 cm. To assess the recovery of soil properties after the disturbance, we sampled sites along a chronosequence with respect to time since harvesting.

Here, we investigate the responses of vegetation composition and surface chemistry (vegetation, surface peat, and groundwater chemistry) at three ombrotrophic peatlands: Rivière-au-Tonnerre (RT), Chemin de l'Anse-de-la-Grande-Pointe (GP), and Kegaska (KEG) in eastern Québec, Canada, to varying levels of road dust deposition with differential chemical composition. At each site, a transect aligned with the dominant wind direction, starting at and perpendicular to the roadside, was sampled at increasing intervals up to 250 m away from the gravel (unpaved) road. We find that the ash content of surface peat is highest closest to the roads at all three sites and decreases exponentially with increasing distance up to 200 m away from the roads. At KEG, with the highest amount of, and the most phosphorus (P) rich, road dust deposition, the ash content is highest among the three sites, decreasing most rapidly with distance away from the road. The stoichiometric mass ratios of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and P, i.e., C:N, C:P, and N:P, in foliar tissues and surface peat increase significantly with distance away from the road at KEG, and mosses are found to be more responsive in terms of foliar chemistry than shrubs to the road dust deposition. A higher concentration of total dissolved phosphorus at KEG is found closer to the road. At GP, having a moderate amount of road dust deposition, significant increases in C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios with distance are found only in surface peat but not in foliar tissues. Due to the presence of carbonate minerals in the road dust of GP, the calcium (Ca) concentration and pH value of groundwater closer to the road are higher, leading to an obvious loss of vegetation coverage, especially mosses, and a consequent increase in NO3− leaching. In contrast, at RT, having the lowest amount of road dust deposition, only a few clear variation patterns in surface chemistry are found along the sampling transect. Overall, our results suggest that dust from gravel roads can be an important localized source of nutrients for adjacent peatlands and influence their vegetation composition and surface chemistry, depending on the amount of road dust and its chemical composition, especially its contents in Ca and P.","2023-11-01","2025-01-08 20:46:49","2025-03-19 16:04:35","","116665","","","439","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the impact of road dust on the nutrient dynamics and vegetation in ombrotrophic peatlands in Québec.

Defining a disturbance-abundance relationship offers a tool to assess and potentially manage for the influence of disturbance on caribou abundance. Defining this relationship is challenged by limited historical land use and abundance data, the choice of a disturbance measure, and variability in the relationship between subpopulations and across core versus matrix habitat. For 12 subpopulations of woodland caribou within the southern mountain population, we linked longitudinal caribou abundance data with historical forestry disturbances simulated from forest harvest data. We compared disturbance measures estimating the proportion of forested area commercially harvested with even-aged, regeneration treatments (cutblocks) and converted to roads for transporting timber within subpopulation-specific core and matrix habitats as predictors of caribou abundance. Non-linear mixed models provided evidence that disturbances in matrix habitats negatively influenced caribou abundance, with the effects in core habitat being variable between subpopulations. Of the disturbance types evaluated, the best predictors included roads buffered by 50 m (R50), cutblocks <= 80 years old, and the cumulation of cutblocks <= 80 years old plus roads buffered by 50 m. The top-ranked model was composed of R50 present in core and in matrix habitats. This model predicted a 42% (95% CI = 33-51%) reduction in caribou abundance for every 1% increase in matrix R50 (holding core R50 constant). Given the lack of pre-forestry abundance data, we failed to directly derive critical disturbance thresholds; however, our models could be used to estimate subpopulation-specific habitat-disturbance thresholds necessary to achieve abundance targets. We recommend that in addition to existing protections of core habitat, few if any new roads should be built in core habitat, and that timber harvest in matrix habitat should be designed to minimize the establishment of associated roads.","2022-01","2025-01-08 20:46:50","2025-03-12 01:49:50","","","","1","86","","J.

The embankments were constructed using locally sourced sand and sawdust and have behaved very well with the sawdust settling beneath the water table as designed and remaining in perfect condition some 60 years later.

Historically, these factors have been difficult to measure in the field, constraining our capacity to observe local patterns of variability. In this paper, we show how remote sensing surveys conducted from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms can be used to map microtopography and depth to water over large areas with good accuracy, paving the way for spatially explicit estimates of CH4 emissions. This approach enabled us to observe for the first time the effects of low-impact seismic lines (LIS; petroleum exploration corridors) on surface morphology and CH4 emissions in a treed-bog ecosystem in northern Alberta, Canada. Through compaction, LIS lines were found to flatten the observed range in microtopographic elevation by 46cm and decrease mean depth to water by 15.4cm, compared to surrounding undisturbed conditions. These alterations are projected to increase CH4 emissions by 20-120% relative to undisturbed areas in our study area, which translates to a total rise of 0.011-0.027kgCH(4)day(-1) per linear kilometer of LIS (similar to 2m wide).

We argue that a Sphagnum-dominated peatland can only be considered functionally 'restored' once organic matter accumulation has achieved a thickness where the mean water table position in a drought year does not extend into the underlying formerly cutover peat surface. Here we monitor the spatio-temporal development of organic matter accumulation in a new peat layer for the first 8 years following the restoration of a Quebec peatland and couple a simple acrotelm carbon accumulation model and ecohydrological model to assess peatland restoration success. We determined that organic matter accumulation increased from 2.3 1.7 cm 4 years post-restoration to 13.6 6.5 cm 8 years post-restoration. For comparison, at an adjacent non-restored section of the peatland organic matter accumulation was significantly lower (p 0.001 for all years), with mean thicknesses of 0.2 0.6 and 0.8 1.2 cm for 24 and 28 years post-extraction, respectively. Given the mean summer water deficit at the site (-64 mm), our ecohydrological modeling results suggest that a 19-cm-thick moss layer would be required to offset the water table decrease induced by the summer water deficit. Given the current rate of organic matter accumulation, net primary productivity and the new peat layer decomposition rates determined using litter bags, we estimate it will take 17 years post-restoration to accumulate a 19-cm moss layer. Consequently, we argue that successful peatland restoration may be achieved in the medium-term and that our simple modeling approach can be useful in assessing the long-term impact of restoration on atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Basal microbial respiration, relative response to substrate addition (four synthetic and four natural substrates) assessed as CO2 production rates and microbial biomass were assessed in surface (0-10 cm) peat samples. Bacterial and fungal communities within the peat samples were profiled using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Basal respiration (i.e., carbon mineralization in absence of substrate addition) was lowest and Cu and Ni concentrations and the degree of humification (assessed by the von Post scale) in surface peat samples were highest close to the smelter. Each peatland had a unique bacterial community when assessed using non-metric multidimensional scaling, whereas the fungal community was variable with no consistent patterns across the sites. Despite differences in microbial communities, substrate-induced respiration rates did not differ among peatlands as sites generally responded similarly to carbon substrate additions. Basal respiration rates were related to the humification status of the peat, which was potentially related to environmental degradation in the peatlands or surrounding terrestrial systems closer to the Sudbury smelters.","2015-02","2025-01-08 20:46:50","2025-03-07 22:07:11","","","","2","226","","Water Air Soil Pollut","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.9","4","","<p>- This paper examines the carbon decomposition and CO2 dynamics of peatlands affected by decades of Cu and Ni <br/>pollution from metal smelters.</p>","","","Canada; Ontario; cumulative effects; peatland; decomposition; greenhouse gases; peat; microbial activity; mineral processing; carbon cycle; metal/metalloid; substrate; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a consequence of the forestry drainage, the area of pristine spruce swamp forests has declined drastically in northern Europe over the past century. In restoration by rewetting, drainage ditches are blocked to restore the pre-disturbance hydrological regime and, ultimately, the biodiversity values and ecosystem functions of pristine spruce swamp forests. In this study, we quantify vegetation recovery and examine mechanisms behind the changes in plant community composition. For this, we surveyed the understorey vegetation of 9 undrained, 9 drained and 18 rewetted spruce swamp forest sites in southern Finland. The vegetation survey was accompanied by water table (WT) position and tree stand measurements. Sphagnum cover decreased after drainage and increased after rewetting. Drainage increased the cover of the unvegetated ground surface, while the cover of moss species other than Sphagnum and feather mosses was highest in the rewetted group. A constrained ordination analysis shows that following rewetting, species composition had developed towards the undrained reference state. Regarding their plant community composition, the rewetted sites were situated in the middle of the undrained–drained axis, differing significantly from both the undrained and the drained sites. Similarity to the undrained reference state depended on current WT and was driven by the Sphagnum mosses. Among the rewetted sites, which varied in their rewetting age from 1 to 14 years, similarity to undrained was not dependent on time since rewetting. The most important predictors for the between-site variation in plant community composition were the division between the undrained and the other (drained or rewetted) sites, WT position and birch volume. Species diversity was lower in the undrained than in the drained and rewetted sites, mainly due to lower species evenness. It appears that the competitive superiority of the Sphagnum mosses in wet conditions results in a lower species diversity in the undrained reference state. The less optimal conditions for Sphagna that result from drainage enable higher diversity by opening space for other species.","2014-10-15","2025-01-08 20:46:50","2025-03-13 19:02:55","","115-125","","","330","","For.

However, there has been no quantitative evaluation of vegetation communities on open pipelines as compared to the adjacent intact forest. We compared the cover of ground vegetation by vegetation type, and the cover and composition for plant taxa known for their importance as woodland caribou and grizzly bear forage, between plots located on pipeline corridors, near the edge of the pipeline corridor, and in the adjacent undisturbed forest across six different boreal forest ecosite types in west-central and north-western Alberta, Canada. Pipeline corridors were characterized by higher total ground vegetation cover, and cover of low shrubs, lichens, bryophyte and of targeted forage species of low shrubs, bryophytes, and lichens. In contrast, pipelines had higher graminoid cover and cover of target forage species of tall shrubs and graminoids, as compared to adjacent forest. Despite the substantive differences in cover and composition of ground vegetation among the ecosite types, differences between pipelines and the adjacent forest were quite consistent, with a few exceptions. For instance, forb cover was higher in the adjacent forest compared with pipelines in shrubby ecosite types, but was similar across plot locations in other ecosites. Species composition also varied among ecosites and differed between the adjacent forest and on pipelines; with pipelines dominated by graminoids, particularly Carex species. Our results demonstrate that pipelines influence ground vegetation communities, and cover and composition of wildlife forage species, across the boreal forest landscapes of Alberta; we suggest this results in pipelines being a potential ecological sink for wildlife populations, including threatened caribou. To ensure pipelines can recover, restoration strategies that promote natural recovery or purposeful re-planting may be required to accelerate forest re-establishment and put inactive pipeline corridors within caribou ranges on a recovery trajectory. Our results suggest that ecosites can be used to prioritize pipelines where restoration or management actions may be the most beneficial.","2020-07","2025-01-08 20:46:51","2025-03-07 18:19:48","","","","","468","","For.

Air temperature in the Hudson Plains is increasing rapidly leading to unprecedented permafrost thaw. The region's remoteness has hindered our knowledge of how permafrost thaw alters peatland land cover and hydrological response at multiple scales. To assess which landscapes in the Hudson Plains are vulnerable to such disturbances, we analysed latitudinal distributions of land cover over a 300-km transect spanning the sporadic (<30% areal) to continuous (>80% areal) permafrost zone in northern Ontario and quantified land cover changes over 40 years using multiple remote sensing datasets (lidar, air photographs, and high-resolution satellite imagery). We then evaluated these landscapes at a fundamental hydrological unit, the peatland complex, identified five peatland complex types, and conceptualized their potential hydrological response using circuitry analogues. Over four decades, we found that permafrost peatlands declined by 4%, 8.5%, and 2% areal in the sporadic, discontinuous, and continuous permafrost zones, respectively. Circuitry analogues partitioned peatland complexes into their component peatland forms (e.g., permafrost peatland, bog, and fen) and represented each component's hydrological function using an electrical equivalent (e.g., generator, switch, and conductor). When interpreted at the landscape scale, circuitry analogues demonstrated latitudinal patterns in landscape structure (i.e., circuitry wiring) and indicated where permafrost thaw will have the greatest impact on landscape structure (i.e., rewiring) and therefore hydrological response. Based on these analyses, we suggest a 60-km latitudinal segment (54.5 degrees N to 54.9 degrees N) where peatland complexes are most vulnerable to permafrost-thaw-induced land cover and hydrological change and should therefore be the focus of future research and monitoring efforts.","2023-09","2025-01-08 20:46:51","2025-03-07 18:27:30","","","","6","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.6","3","SC: 0000002","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the vulnerability of permafrost within peatlands in the discontinuous permafrost zone in the Hudson Bay Lowland to warming.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; climate change; hydrology; peatland; permafrost; permafrost thaw; substrate disturbance; Hudson Bay Lowland; substrate; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is not clear if patterns will be consistent across different peatland types or within peatlands given the natural range of ecohydrological conditions within these systems. We examined the effect of persistent drought on peatland nutrient dynamics by quantifying the effects of an experimentally lowered water table position (drained for a 10-year period) on peat KCl-extractable total inorganic nitrogen (ext-TIN), peat KCl-extractable nitrate (ext-NO3−), and water-extractable ortho-phosphorus (ext-PO43−) concentrations and net phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification rates at natural (control) and drained microforms (hummocks, lawns) of a bog and poor fen near Québec City, Canada. Drainage (water table drawdown) decreased net nitrification rates across the landscape and increased ext-NO3− concentrations, but did not affect net N and P mineralization rates or ext-TIN and ext-PO43− concentrations. We suggest that the thick capillary fringe at the drained peatland likely maintained sufficient moisture above the water table to limit the effects of drainage on microbial activity, and a 20 cm lowering of the water table does not appear to have been sufficient to create a clear difference in nutrient dynamics in this peatland landscape. We found some evidence of differences in nutrient concentrations with microforms, where concentrations were greater in lawn than hummock microforms at control sites indicating some translocation of nutrients. In general, the same microtopographic differences were not observed at drained sites. The general spatial patterns in nutrient concentrations did not reflect net mineralization/immobilization rates measured at our control or drained peatlands. Rather, the spatial patterns in nutrient availability may be regulated by differences in vegetation (mainly Sphagnum moss) cover between control and drained sites and possibly differences in hydrologic connection between microforms. Our results suggest that microform distribution and composition within a peatland may be important for determining how peatland nutrient dynamics will respond to water table drawdown in northern peatlands, as some evidence of microtopographic differences in nutrient dynamics was found.","2013-03-01","2025-01-08 20:46:51","2025-03-07 21:59:20","","661-676","","1","112","","Biogeochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","2","","<p>- This paper examines the impact of drainage on the nutrient dynamics of fen and bog communities. </p>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; climate change; hydrology; peatland; bog; nutrients; water table; drawdown; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The measured CH4 fluxes from the reference point without any wastewater load were in the range of those reported from northern pristine peatlands while emissions from treatment peatlands were greatly reduced, presumably as result of high sulfate concentration in the porewater.

The encroaching tree layer was removed, and the restoration measures examined were rewetting by ditch blocking, mowing, and peat disturbance (removing vegetation and mixing the surface peat). At both sites, rewetting alone (without mowing or peat disturbance) led to small changes in species composition. In plots with peat disturbance, several characteristic rich fen species established, probably from a persistent diaspore bank or from refugia nearby. The disturbance treatment also prevented a rapid reestablishment of dominant grasses and mosses that had spread since drainage.

R.","The hydrochemical fate and transport of treated domestic wastewater contaminants during a wastewater polishing experiment in a sub-arctic ladder fen peatland","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/10012/10937","Protecting northern aquatic ecosystems is critical to ensuring the sustained use of these environments; however, with increasing industrial and residential development pressures in this region the safe and effective treatment of domestic wastewater is becoming a concern. Globally, peatlands have been used successfully to treat and polish domestic wastewater in northern environments but there is a dearth of knowledge on contaminant transport in peatlands, specifically reactive contaminants; such as the constituents of domestic wastewater. Ladder fens act as the conveyers of water, and likely solutes, from the bog peatlands to the aquatic ecosystems and similar systems have been used for domestic wastewater treatment. Ladder fens consist of a pool-rib-pool topography where the flow of water is governed by the peat ribs and their associated microtopography. Within a given rib, there are two distinct microtopographies: topographically high ridges that impede water flow and topographically low preferential flow paths that enhance water flow during periods of high water tables. Thus, the hydrological, and potentially solute, connectivity is thought to be controlled by the surface elevation of the low-lying preferential flow paths. However, the mechanisms governing the hydrological connectivity of these systems is still relatively unknown. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge on the processes and mechanisms that govern the fate and transport of contaminants, such as domestic wastewater, in ladder fens. Understanding the processes and mechanisms governing the hydrology, solute transport, and contaminant removal is critical to safely and effectively using these systems for domestic wastewater treatment or polishing; thus, is the primary objective of this thesis.    To elucidate these processes and mechanisms in ladder fens, a continuous experimental simulated-domestic wastewater release occurred in 2014 (day of year 192 – 243) with an associated hydrological load (2014 – 38 m3 day-1 and 2015 – 30 m3 day-1) in a small sub-arctic ladder fen (EXP Fen) in the James Bay Lowland, Ontario, Canada approximately 100 km west of Attawapiskat. Typical domestic wastewater contaminants, nitrate (7.6 mg L-1), ammonium (9.1 mg L-1), and phosphate (7.4 mg L-1), were injected into the EXP Fen, along with sulphate (27.2 mg L-1), sodium (25.3 mg L-1), and chloride (47.2 mg L-1) to better mimic local domestic wastewater conditions. Given that sulphate can enhance the methylation of mercury in peatlands, total dissolved mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations were measured at the EXP Fen in addition to the hydrological and biogeochemical conditions throughout the summers of 2014 and 2015. Prior to the experimental loading the background geochemical and hydrological conditions were monitored in 2013 at the EXP Fen and at 3 nearby reference sites (2013 – 2015).  The flow of water and solutes in ladder fens depends on the hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity distributions within the peat ribs and the surface elevation of the low-lying preferential flow paths. The low-lying preferential flow paths typically had higher hydraulic conductivity within the upper 0.1 m of the saturated peat than equivalent elevation in the ridges. Yet, overland flow events vastly increased the hydrological connectivity and runoff ratios exceed 1 during these events (when excluding the pumped water). Once overland flow occurred, the rate of water movement from the top of the system to the bottom decreased from weeks to hours. However, when the water table resides within the upper peat layers rapid conservative solute (chloride) transport was observed. The high hydraulic conductivity (16 – 598 m day-1) in upper peat layers resulted in high conservative solute velocities (1.9 m day-1), while adsorptive (sodium) solute velocities were only slightly lower (1.1 m day-1). Although the solute velocities were high, it was still lower than the average linear groundwater velocity (2.1 m day-1), resulting in a retardation factor of 1.2 for chloride and 2.1 for sodium. The retardation factor for chloride, a conservative solute, greater than 1 was likely due to diffusion into the inactive porosity of the peat (0.29 – 0.44). This processes likely influenced all contaminants studied.  Similar to other treatment or polishing peatlands, the EXP Fen was highly effective at removing all contaminants from the pore water and no contaminants were detected at the site outflow. Nitrate was only transported 0.5 m into Rib 1, while ammonium (0.3 m day-1) and phosphate (0.2 m day-1) were transported further, yet were still relatively immobile. Initially, phosphate was completely immobile but the system saturated towards phosphate, resulting in a mobile contaminant. Sulphate, unlike the other contaminants, was very mobile (1.3 m day-1) within the EXP Fen, more similar to chloride and sodium. Additionally, within the sulphate plume elevated THg and MeHg concentrations were observed compared to background and reference site concentrations. Methylmercury, as a percentage of THg, comprised 80 -100 % in the pore water but no MeHg was observed at the site outflow. The enhanced generation of MeHg and THg is potentially a concern when using ladder fens as wastewater polishing or treatment peatlands due to the high mobility of sulphate. However, the efficient removal of all contaminants from the pore water suggests that ladder fens may be suitable for domestic wastewater treatment. Nevertheless, ensuring the water table is below the high hydraulic conductivity layers would greatly decrease the transport rates, thus increasing treatment, allowing for the safe operation of ladder fens as treatment wetlands.","2016","2025-01-08 20:46:51","2025-03-12 01:43:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Waterloo","Waterloo, ON","","","","","","","","SC: 0000003","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis examines the fate of nutrients and mercury in a small ladder fen.

Undisturbed fen peatlands have been used to minimize the release of contaminants to the aquatic ecosystems; however, there is a limited understanding of wastewater transport or polishing in undisturbed fen peatlands. To elucidate these processes, a small (9800 m2, ~ 250 m long) ladder fen was continuously injected with a wastewater surrogate derived from a custom fertilizer blend and 38 m3 day− 1 of water for 51 days. The simulated wastewater included sulphate (27.2 mg L− 1), nitrate (7.6 mg L− 1), ammonium (9.1 mg L− 1), phosphate (7.4 mg L− 1), and chloride (47.2 mg L− 1). Major ion, total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) pore water concentrations were measured throughout the study period. No wastewater contaminants were detected in the site outlet (~ 250 m down-gradient) and most wastewater contaminants, except for SO42 − and Cl−, remained relatively immobile. Within the SO42 − plume, MeHg and THg concentrations became highly elevated relative to background (up to 10 ng L− 1, ~ three to five-fold increase) and MeHg comprised 60–100% of dissolved THg in the pore water. No MeHg or THg was exported at the outflow. The large increase in THg cannot be solely accounted for by the increase in MeHg and was likely due to enhanced decomposition of the peat substrate by increased microbial activity due to electron acceptor loading. Since the added nutrients were effectively transformed, sequestered or otherwise removed from pore waters in this experimental system, it appears that fen peatlands have a large capacity to safely treat residential wastewater nutrients; however, the inadvertent increases in THg and MeHg require further investigation and potential management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2025-01-08 20:46:51","2025-03-12 01:43:31","","1349-1360","","","609","","Sci.

The ability of peatlands to retain TMMs results from a host of interacting hydrological, biological, geomorphological, and chemical feedbacks, which underpin peatland functionality in general. Fire is a transformative force that often disrupts these interactions and feedbacks, leading to the potential release of TMMs to our air, land, and water. Given that wildfire burned area and severity are increasing there is a need for a conceptual understanding of these interactive processes. Prior to a fire, peatland TMM mobility is relatively low, controlled by a peatland's degree of minerotrophy, degradation status, hydrogeomorphic setting and hydroclimate. Incidentally, these peatland characteristics also control the likelihood of peat ignition, creating important feedbacks on the landscape. Following ignition, the temperature and duration of a peat fire plays a critical role in determining the potential TMM emissions to the atmosphere and the post-fire geochemical conditions. We elucidate the varied emission factors of different metals, where emission factors range from 0.2 (Co or Cd) to 300 (Al) mg of metal per kg of particulate matter emitted depending on the specific metal and likely the pre-fire peat metal concentration. Following a peat fire, the geochemical and hydrological changes become increasingly important. For example, post-fire increases in pH play the strongest chemical role in limiting TMM mobilization but concurrent increases in dissolved organic matter aromaticity complicate our understanding of these processes, leading to a critical knowledge gap. At larger spatial scales, peatland and watershed ecohydrological connectivity and peat erosion modulate the release of TMMs to aquatic systems. Yet, the evolution of the ecohydrological connectivity and peat erosion potential as the peatland vegetation and hydrology recover to pre-fire conditions over the course of several to tens of years is governed by the same controls that impact pre-fire TMM mobility. Critically, the uncertainty in evolution trajectories depends on changes in biological, hydrological, climatological, and chemical conditions, limiting our ability to accurately predict these changes under a rapidly changing climate. This extensive and interdisciplinary review guides the development of a conceptual framework and highlights future research needs to better respond to the emerging threat of legacy TMM release from peatland wildfires.","2024-09","2025-01-08 20:46:52","2025-03-07 21:59:19","","","","","256","","Earth-Sci.

Returning the ecosystem functionality to these degraded peatlands remains a challenge due to adverse ecohydrological conditions and elevated peat pollutant concentrations, such as nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu), at the remnant peat surface. However, field-scale trials can be labour, time, and monetarily expensive with no guarantee of success. As a precursor to field-scale trials, we use a 10-year coupled hydrological and solute transport models in Hydrus-1D to assess the feasibility of using peat-block transplants to restore a peatland contaminated by Ni and Cu. The exceedance of critical capitula hydrological (soil water tension >100 mbar) and chemical ([Ni] and [Cu] > 10−6 mmol mL−1) thresholds that correspond with increased Sphagnum physiological stress were assessed using a series of modelled scenarios with varying peat-block thicknesses (5 to 30 cm in 5 cm increments), <i>Sphagnum </i>species (<i>S. fuscum</i>, <i>S. rubellum</i>, <i>S. magellanicum,</i> and an average <i>Sphagnum</i>), and initial contaminant loads (i.e., distance from a smelter). When the remnant peat contaminant load was largest (i.e., closer to a smelter) and the transplant thickness was 5 cm, the combined hydrological threshold and chemical thresholds in the capitula were exceeded in as little as least 2 years, while thicker transplants did not exceed the concentration threshold after 10 years. In general, the average <i>Sphagnum </i>exceeded the hydrological threshold most, followed by <i>S. magellanicum</i>, <i>S. rubellum</i>, and <i>S. fuscum</i>, respectively. A Monte Carlo and sensitivity analyses showed that the results of our modelling scenarios were generally robust. Based on these results, we suggest that targeting thicker (>20 cm) peat-blocks of <i>S. fuscum </i>and <i>S. rubellum</i> (i.e., densely growing <i>Sphagnum </i>spp.), would likely provide a suitable peat-block for transplant. This research provides a critical path forward for restoring contaminated and degraded peatlands.","2023-02","2025-01-08 20:46:52","2025-03-07 18:20:55","","","","","187","","Ecol.

This research assesses the restored site's (RES) hydrological condition after 10 growing seasons (May 15th-August 15th, 2010) through comparison with an adjacent unrestored site (UNR) and a natural site (NAT) located elsewhere in the peatland. Evapotranspiration (ET) from RES (242 mm) has not noticeably changed since the first 3 years post-restoration (2000-2002) still maintaining lower ET rates than UNR (290 mm). The highest ET occurred at NAT (329 mm), dissimilar to RES despite similar vegetation cover. UNR generates more runoff (37 mm) than RES (7 mm), similar to the initial assessments. However, since the initial assessments the average water table has continued to rise, from -35.3 (+/- 6.2) cm (2000-2002) to -27.3 (+/- 14.9) cm (2010) below the cutover peat surface but still fluctuates predominantly within the cutover peat and not the regenerated Sphagnum. The regenerated Sphagnum at RES has increased the surface elevation by similar to 15-20 cm, and with respect to its surface the average water table was at similar to-42.3 ( +/- 20.9) cm. However, its water table was still lower (and more variable) than at NAT (33.2 +/- 9.0 cm), with respect to the moss surface. Average soil water pressures in 2010 were similar to the early post-restoration condition at depths of 10 cm (-43.0 +/- 12.2 and -44.1 +/- 13.1 mb) and 20 cm (-41.4 +/- 13.0 and -40.6 +/- 10.5 mb) below the cutover surface at RES and UNR, respectively. Volumetric soil moisture contents (theta) at 2.5, 7.5 and 17.5 cm depths were higher in the Sphagnum moss at NAT (0.23, 0.31, and 0.71) compared to RES (0.12, 0.11, and 0.23), where the underlying cutover peat had a relatively high theta of 0.74. The low moisture content in the new moss overlying the relatively moist cutover peat indicates there was restricted connectivity between the two layers. Ten years following the implementation of restoration measures and the development of a near complete 15 cm thick Sphagnum moss layer, further time is required for the moss layer to develop (increase in thickness and bulk density, hence water retention capacity) and more consistently host the water table, so that the average water content more closely mimics NAT.

This study evaluates the hydrophysical properties of Bois-des-Bel, based on a combination of field and monolith experiments at a restored (RES), natural (NAT) and unrestored (UNR) site. The lowest field soil moisture in the Sphagnum moss at RES was 0.09cm(3)cm(-3), while 0.20cm(3)cm(-3) at NAT. These results were similar in both the monolith experiments and individual core hydraulic parameterization (i.e. soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity). The low soil moisture and relatively abundant large pores (>397 mu m) in the RES Sphagnum resulted in low unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (023cmday(-1) at =-35cm) and high specific yield (045) compared with NAT Sphagnum (12cmday(-1) and 010, respectively). The abundance of large pores at RES resulted in hydrological conditions dissimilar to NAT and limited connectivity with the cutover peat, the latter being similar to UNR. To negate the implications of limited connectivity on water transfer from the cutover peat to the regenerated Sphagnum, the water table would need to fluctuate almost entirely within the regenerated Sphagnum layer. This will occur in time, as decomposition and compression cause a decrease in average pore size of the regenerated moss, thus detaining water and resulting in a higher water table.","2015-03","2025-01-08 20:46:52","2025-03-07 18:19:59","","173-187","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.6","3","SC: 0000074","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the soil pore properties of peats in natural, restored and unrestored peatlands to determine the efficacy of water availability within the restored peat layers a decade after the application of the moss layer transfer technique.</p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; peat; substrate disturbance; soil moisture; bryophytes; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; substrate; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To better understand solute transport in ladder fens under wastewater polishing conditions a continuous solute (NaCl) tracer experiment (38 m3 day−1 of water, chloride – 47.2 mg L−1, and sodium – 25.3 mg L−1) was conducted during the summer of 2014 (day of year 192–243) in a small ladder fen in the James Bay Lowland. The transmissivity distribution and effective porosity (average 0.5) of the peat ribs were determined through repeated bail tests and the drainable porosity of 18 peat cores at −100 mb, respectively. Water samples were taken at least every 7 days to capture the solute (sodium and chloride) plumes. Both solute plumes never reached the site outflow (∼250 m downgradient) and displayed complex plume morphology, typically following the patterns of higher hydraulic conductivity within the upper 0.1 m of the saturated peat, rather than the microtopography. Based on the 50% breakthrough isotherms, sodium and chloride were transported at an average solute velocity of 1.9 and 1.1 m day−1, respectively (average linear groundwater velocity = 2.1 m day−1); thus, the solutes were retarded by a factor of 2.1 and 1.2 for sodium and chloride, respectively. Due to the inherent retardation of solutes into inactive pores and relatively high solute residence times, this study demonstrates the potential for wastewater polishing in ladder fens.","2017-06","2025-01-08 20:46:52","2025-03-12 01:43:32","","558-570","","","549","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6.4","1","SC: 0000025","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates the movement of solutes through a ladder fen in the Hudson Bay Lowland.

However, there is not a thorough understanding of the hydrological processes occurring in these important systems, particularly how ladder fens connect large domed bogs to the aquatic ecosystems that drain the peatland complex. Ladder fens consist of a pool-rib topography where flow downgradient is controlled by the peat ribs. Within the ribs, low-lying preferential flow paths typically enhance the transmission of water, whereas the elevated ridge microforms impede water flow to downgradient aquatic ecosystems. To assess the hydrological connectivity, we study the role of the water table, peat transmissivity, and microtopography of a small ladder fen for 3 summers (2013–2015) in the James Bay Lowland. The system was manipulated with a sustained hydrological forcing (water addition) to the upslope boundary of the fen during 2014 (38 m3/day) and 2015 (30 m3/day). There was an exponential increase in transmissivity towards the peat surface due to extremely high-hydraulic conductivities within the upper few centimeters of the peat deposit. At the maximum water table, the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the 0.1 m layer of peat below the water table varied depending on peat microtopography (preferential flow paths = 42–598 m/day and ridges = 16–52 m/day), resulting in high-hydrological connectivity periods. Furthermore, during 2015, there was an abnormally large amount of precipitation (300 mm vs. long-term average ~ 100 mm) that resulted in complete surface water connectivity of the site. This caused rapid movement of water from the head of system to the outlet (~15 hr) and runoff ratios >1, compared to low-water table periods (runoff ratio ~ 0.05). This study highlights the profound importance of the transmissivity–water table feedback mechanism in ladder fens, on controlling the water retention and drainage of large peatland complexes.","2017","2025-01-08 20:46:52","2025-03-12 01:43:33","","1578-1589","","8","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.2","3","SC: 0000027","<p>- This paper examines the flow of water through a ladder fen that was going to be used to experimentally treat simulated tertiary-treated wastewater at a mine site.</p>","","","Canada; Ontario; hydrology; peatland; groundwater; contaminant transport; impact minimization; treatment wetland; fen; mitigation hierarchy; Hudson Bay Lowland; string fen / aapa mire; remediation; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These processes are strongly influenced by the complex pore structure of peat soils. We explore the literature on peat pore structure and the implications for hydrological, biogeochemical, and microbial processes in peat, highlighting the gaps in our current knowledge and a path to move forward. Peat is an elastic and multi-porous structured organic soil. Surficial (near-surface) peats are typically dominated by large interconnected macropores that rapidly transmit water and solutes when saturated, but these large pores drain rapidly with a reduction in pore-water pressure, and disproportionally decrease the bulk effective hydraulic conductivity, thus water fluxes that drive ecohydrological functions. The more advanced state of decomposition of older (deeper) peat, with a greater abundance of small pores, restricts the loss of moisture at similar soil water pressures and is associated with higher unsaturated hydraulic conductivities. As evaporation and precipitation occur, peat soils shrink and swell, respectively, changing the hydrological connectivity that maintain physiological processes at the peat surface. Due to the disproportionate change in pore structure and associated hydraulic properties with state of decomposition, transport processes are limited at depth, creating a zone of enhanced transport in the less decomposed peat near the surface. At the micro-scale, rapid equilibration of solutes and water occurs between the mobile and immobile pores due to diffusion, resulting in pore regions with similar chemical concentrations that are not affected by advective fluxes. These immobile regions may be the primary sites for microbial biogeochemical processes in peat. Mass transfer limitations may therefore largely regulate belowground microbial turnover and, hence, biogeochemical cycling. For peat, the development of a comprehensive theory that links the hydrological, biological, and biogeochemical processes will require a concerted interdisciplinary effort. To that end, we have highlighted four primary areas to focus our collective research: 1) understanding the combined and interrelated effects of parent material, decomposition, and nutrient status on peat pore connectivity, macropore development and collapse, and solute transport, 2) determining the influence of changing pore structure due to freeze-thaw or dewatering on the hydrology and biogeochemistry, 3) better elucidating the non-equilibrium transport processes in peat, and 4) exploring the implications of peat's pore structure on microbiological and biogeochemical processes.","2020","2025-01-08 20:46:52","2025-03-07 18:21:45","","","","","207","","Earth-Sci.

There is little empirical evidence, however, of how quickly methyl-Hg (MeHg, a bioaccumulative neurotoxin) export from catchments might change with declining SO42- deposition. Here, we present responses in total Hg (THg), MeHg, total organic carbon, pH, and SO42- export from a peatland-dominated catchment as a function of changing SO42- deposition in a long-term (1998-2011), whole-ecosystem, control-impact experiment. Annual SO42- deposition to half of a 2-ha peatland was experimentally increased 6-fold over natural levels and then returned to ambient levels in two phases. Sulfate additions led to a 5-fold increase in monthly flow-weighted MeHg concentrations and yields relative to a reference catchment. Once SO42- additions ceased, MeHg concentrations in the outflow streamwater returned to pre-SO42- addition levels within 2 years. The decline in streamwater MeHg was proportional to the change in the peatland area no longer receiving experimental SO42- inputs. Importantly, net demethylation and increased sorption to peat hastened the return of MeHg to baseline levels beyond purely hydrological flushing. Overall, we present clear empirical evidence of rapid and proportionate declines in MeHg export from a peatland-dominated catchment when SO42- deposition declines.","2022-12-20","2025-01-08 20:46:52","2025-03-07 22:07:12","","17615-17625","","24","56","","Environ.

Previous experiments with peat have only evaluated single-component solutions, such that no information exists on solute transport of potentially competitively adsorbing ions to the peat matrix. Additionally, recent studies suggest chloride (Cl-) might not be conservative in peat, as assumed by many past peat solute transport studies. Based on measured and modelled adsorption isotherms, this study illustrates concentration dependent adsorption of Cl- to peat occurred in equilibrium adsorption batch (EAB) experiments, which could be described with a Sips isotherm. However, Cl- adsorption was insignificant for low concentrations (< 500 mg L-1 ) as used in breakthrough curve experiments (BTC). We found that competitive adsorption of Na+, K+, and NH4+ transport could be observed in EAB and BTC, depending on the dissolved ion species present. Na+ followed a Langmuir isotherm, K+ a linear isotherm within the tested concentration range (similar to 10 - 1500 mg L-1 ), while the results for NH4+ are inconclusive due to potential microbial degradation. Only Na+ showed clear evidence of competitive behaviour, with an order of magnitude decrease in maximum adsorption capacity in the presence of NH4+ (0.22 to 0.02 mol kg(-1)), which was confirmed by the BTC data where the Na+ retardation coefficient differed between the experiments with different cations. Thus, solute mobility in peatlands is affected by competitive adsorption.","2018-10","2025-01-08 20:46:53","2025-02-08 18:44:51","","17-31","","","217","","J. Contam.

Anthropogenic disturbances, such as peatland drainage and harvesting, are often followed by peatland restoration that aims to return the carbon sink function. This is typically achieved by raising the water table and re-establishing keystone Sphagnum moss species. However, with an increasingly uncertain climate and intensifying land-use changes, the potential for multiple disturbances (such as co-occurring wildfires, drainage, and harvesting) to disrupt the ecohydrological feedbacks that support peatland function is increasing. Yet, few studies investigate the ecohydrological trade-offs induced by multiple disturbances in peatlands. To elucidate the complexities of multiple disturbances and restoration on Sphagnum re-establishment and wildfire potential, we studied a Deep and Shallow harvested area in a drained and restored peatland in southern Ontario, Canada that experienced a wildfire in 2012. Harvesting depth did not significantly increase the bulk density of the upper 32 cm of exposed peat, but the shallower harvest depth did significantly increase the depth of burn (DOB) due to the more varied remnant topography. The difference in topography of the shallower harvested area increased peat carbon losses (16.5 kg C m(-2)) from the wildfire relative to the deeper harvest area (15.1 kg C m(-2)). The difference in post-fire peat hydrophysical properties of the Deep and Shallow harvest area drove divergent soil water conditions. In the post-burn peat, the establishment of suitable conditions for the regeneration of Sphagnum mosses was more prevalent at the Shallow harvest areas but the higher soil water retention capabilities of the Deep harvest peat lowered the risk of subsequent peat ignition. This study highlights the complex interactions multiple disturbances have on peatland ecohydrology and that we urgently need to understand these interactions to better manage our shared peatland resources in an increasingly uncertain future.","2021-10","2025-01-08 20:46:53","2025-03-19 16:04:37","","","","","601","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6.4","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the cumulative and interacting effects of peat extraction, fire, drawdown and restoration on the hydrology of a large historically extracted peatland in the Niagara region.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; climate change; cumulative effects; fire; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; peat; substrate disturbance; drawdown; bryophytes; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; substrate; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Trace element concentrations in lichens and bryophytes have not been reported in the Hudson Bay Lowlands. Here, we seek to determine the baseline trace element concentrations of six non-vascular species (Evernia mesomorpha, Bryoria spp., Cladonia stellaris, Cladonia stygia, Sphagnum fuscum, and Sphagnum capillifolium) common to the region, explore linear relationships of trace elements with iron (Fe) as a signature of particulates with geogenic origin, and calculate trace element enrichment factors.

Thalli and foliar concentrations are among the lowest reported in the broader literature and differ substantially from peat. Fe concentrations were significantly correlated (Pearson’s r ≥ 0.8) with aluminum (Al), titanium (Ti), and vanadium (V) in all six species. Enrichment factors show some anthropogenic deposition effects non-vascular organism chemistry. Most trace element concentrations in lichens and bryophytes are indicative of long-range atmospheric transport of dust, but some is attributed to industry, with only minimal inclusions from the local area.

These habitat changes are linked to increased predation risk and unsustainable mortality rates for caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). To inform effective habitat restoration, our goal was to examine whether specific linear disturbance features were associated with caribou predation in central mountain caribou ranges. We used predation-caused caribou mortalities and caribou GPS-collar data collected between 2008 and 2015 to assess caribou predation risk within and outside of protected areas at four spatio-temporal scales: habitat use during the (a) 30 days, (b) 7 days, and (c) 24 hours prior to caribou being killed, and (d) characteristics at caribou kill site locations. Outside of protected areas, predation risk increased closer to pipelines, seismic lines, and streams. Within protected areas, predation risk increased closer to alpine habitat. Factors predicting predation risk differed among spatio-temporal scales and linear feature types: predation risk increased closer to pipelines during the 30 and 7 days prior to caribou being killed and closer to seismic lines during the 30 days, 7 days, and 24 hours prior, but decreased closer to roads during the 30 days prior to being killed. By assessing habitat use prior to caribou being killed, we identified caribou predation risk factors that would not have been detected by analysis of kill site locations alone. These results provide further evidence that restoration of anthropogenic linear disturbance features should be an immediate priority for caribou recovery in central mountain caribou ranges.","2021-03","2025-01-08 20:46:53","2025-03-07 22:07:55","","2234-2248","","5","11","","Ecol.

In the case of the investigation reported herein, a laboratory wind tunnel study was designed to systematically simulate PM10 emissions from mine tailings for a range of surface treatments. Unique challenges were associated with the project in the sense that the proposed mine and tailings did not exist at the time of the investigation, so that it was impossible to work on-site. Only a small amount of slurry from a milled drill core was available to work with, and there were no established test protocols and few experimental precedents to work from. The slurry formed highly cohesive bricks when dried, similar to crusted playas investigated in field experiments. The PM10 emissions demonstrated strong temporal variation with particle supply limitation. A small amount of vertical dust dispersion was observed, with PM10 concentrations decaying exponentially away from the source. The emission rates obtained are similar in magnitude to those obtained in field analogues. The highly controlled experiment allowed for separation and analysis of several physical controls on PM10 emissions from tailings; namely, the study addressed the degree of disturbance, shrinkage and cracking, and the effects of spigotting, particle settling and re-wetting.","2009-01-01","2025-01-08 20:46:53","2025-03-07 21:59:18","","520-529","","3","43","","Atmos.

The introduction of fen mosses onto residual mineral well pads following their partial removal has been proposed as a novel technique to restore these sites. However, it has remained unclear whether this would support the requisite hydrological conditions for fen moss establishment. To assess this, a field study of hydrological function at a partially removed pad undergoing restoration near Slave Lake, Alberta, Canada was undertaken. Specifically, the hydrophysical properties of the residual fill and adjacent peatland (including hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, and porosity) were characterized, and related to subsurface flow and water table regulation within the partially removed pad and adjacent peatland. The results demonstrate that flow through the peatland was disrupted by the low saturated hydraulic conductivity of the residual fill (1.15 × 10−5 m s−1) and the compacted underlying peat (4.91 × 10−6 m s−1), resulting in preferential flow around the pad. On the residual pad, hydrological connectivity with the adjacent peatland resulted in a well-regulated, near-surface water table across nearly half of its surface area. However, limitations on subsurface flow through the pad footprint resulted in variable hydrological dynamics across much of its interior. These findings suggest that partially removed well pads have the potential to support requisite hydrological conditions for fen moss establishment, but further development of the technique should be undertaken to improve subsurface hydrological connectivity with adjacent peatlands.","2024-12-20","2025-01-08 20:46:53","2025-03-12 01:48:50","","177750","","","957","","Sci.

The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) account for nearly 50% of the land area and stores about 75% of the peatland carbon in the Far North. The HBL is the largest peatland complex with the southernmost distribution of non-alpine permafrost in North America. More than 75% of the HBL occurs in Ontario, where the provincial Far North Act, 2010 includes a land use planning objective of maintaining biological diversity, ecological processes and ecological functions, including the storage and sequestration of carbon in the Far North. Because peatlands account for nearly 75% of the HBL landscape, we reviewed the peatland literature and identified peatland succession, permafrost thaw, hydrology, and fire as potential climate change indicators that drive peatland carbon budgets. As well, remote sensing can be used to scale these indicators to estimate current and project future states of the HBL landscape and the strength of its carbon sink. We propose two hypotheses of potential climate change effects on peatland carbon in the HBL: (1) in northern ecoregions accelerated permafrost thawing and wetter peat enhances methane emissions and (2) in southern ecoregions increased evapotranspiration and drier peat accelerates carbon dioxide losses through peat decomposition (and possible fire). We also propose a climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessment framework for HBL peatlands and discuss challenges to its development and application in land use planning.","2013","2025-01-08 20:46:53","2025-02-08 18:06:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Great Lakes Forestry Centre, Canadian Forestry Service, Natural Resources Canada","Sault Ste Marie, ON","","","","","","","","","<p>- This paper reviews the impacts of climate change on permafrost in the Far North of Ontario.</p>","","","Canada; Ontario; climate change; fire; hydrology; peatland; permafrost; permafrost thaw; bog; substrate disturbance; carbon sequestration; monitoring; carbon cycle; Boreal Shield; fen; Hudson Bay Lowland; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More than 75% of the HBL occurs in Ontario, where the provincial government mandates that ecosystem carbon storage and sequestration be considered in land-use planning. Accomplishing this task requires identifying carbon indicators and assessing their responses to changing ecosystem processes, such as succession, permafrost thaw, and evapotranspiration (ET). Therefore, we synthesized information on peat carbon indicators and ecosystem process from the literature. Findings indicate that the long-term carbon accumulation, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, peat depth, and peatland age were similar (p > 0.10) between dry and wet peatland features. Furthermore, CO2 sequestration displayed the highest variability and ponds were net CO2 emitters. Recent carbon accumulation, CH4 emission, and ET were highest (p &#60; 0.01) in wet features, with CH4 emission displaying wide variation. Increased active layer thickness (105 ± 92 cm per 100 years) in permafrost was the most variable ecosystem process analyzed in this study, while variation in permafrost loss (53 ± 23% per 100 years) was similar to that of carbon accumulation and ET rates. Processes creating wet and pond conditions may increase landscape-scale CO2 and CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, weakening peatland carbon sinks. Dry conditions may reduce CH4 emissions but potentially increase peatland susceptibility to fire. Knowledge of these changes should be useful for climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessments for large landscapes. However, better understanding of variability in CO2 sequestration, CH4 emission, and permafrost dynamics is required to design such assessments for small landscapes.","2014-02-01","2025-01-08 20:46:53","2025-03-12 01:56:40","","84-102","","1","46","","Arct.

However, as mean annual air temperature (MAAT) increases, peat carbon stocks may decrease. We conducted an in-depth synthesis of current knowledge about ecosystem controls on peatland carbon storage and fluxes to constrain the most influential parameters in probabilistic modelling of peat carbon sinks, such as Bayesian belief networks. Evaluated parameters included climate, carbon flux and mass, land cover, landscape position (defined here as elevation), fire records, and current and future climate scenarios for a 74,300 km(2) landscape in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada. The Bayesian belief network was constructed with four tiers: 1) exposure, expressed as MAAT, and the state variables of elevation and land cover; 2) sensitivity, expressed as ecosystem conditions relevant to peat carbon mass and its quality for decomposition, peat wetness, and fire; 3) carbon dioxide and methane fluxes and peat combustion; and 4) vulnerability of peat carbon sink strength under warmer MAAT. Simulations were conducted using current (-3.0 to 0.0 degrees C), moderately warmer (0.1-4.0 degrees C), and severely warmer (4.1-9.0 degrees C) climate scenarios. Results from the severely warmer climate scenario projected an overall drying of peat, with approximately 20% reduction in the strong sink categories of net ecosystem exchange and peat carbon sink strength for the severely and, to a lesser degree, the moderately warmer climate scenarios relative to current MAAT. In the warmest temperature simulation, probability of methane emission decreased slightly and the probability of the strong peat carbon sink strength was 27% lower due to peat combustion. Our Bayesian belief network can assist land planners in decision-making for peatland-dominated landscapes, such as identifying high carbon storage areas and those projected to be at greatest risk of carbon loss due to climate change. Such areas may be designated, for example, as protected or reduced management intensity. The Bayesian belief network presented here is built on an in-depth knowledge synthesis to construct conditional probability tables, so is expected to apply to other peatland-dense jurisdictions by changing only elevation, peatland types, and MAAT.","2021-07-21","2025-01-08 20:46:54","2025-03-10 20:13:10","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.9","3 (低预警)","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents a decision tool for prioritizing peatland areas to protect in the Hudson Bay Lowland, based on existing carbon stores in peat and potential carbon sequestration in the face of climate change.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; climate change; fire; peatland; peat; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; policy discussion paper; Hudson Bay Lowland; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Net ecosystem CO2 exchange and Sphagnum net primary production of an abandoned block-cut bog were measured in the field and in the laboratory using gas exchange techniques to determine the processes controlling CO2 exchange in these ecosystems. 2. Sphagnum net primary production was offset by peat respiration, resulting in the peatland becoming a net source of CO2 during the summer months. 3. Sphagnum photosynthesis was greatest at wet sites. In addition, sites with vascular plant cover photosynthesized at approximately twice the rate of sites where vascular plants were removed. 4. Laboratory results indicate that drying and wetting cycles negatively affect Sphagnum net primary production and net ecosystem CO2 exchange. Sphagnum and peat respiration increased 4–14-fold upon rewetting, whereas Sphagnum photosynthesis did not recover until 20 days of saturation. 5. Synthesis and applications. This research emphasizes the importance of stable moisture availability for the growth of Sphagnum and the eventual development of a new acrotelm on the cutover bog surface.

We tracked species composition, diversity, and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in chambers warmed at a wide range of temperatures (+0, +2.25, +4.5, +6.75, +9 °C), and two CO2 levels (~400 [ambient] and 900 parts per million). We observed an increase in aboveground vascular plant biomass accumulation, due primarily to an increase in shrub abundance. Overall species diversity decreased substantially, likely due in part to shading by increases in shrub density. The main driver of change in the vascular plant community was temperature, with minimal effects of CO2 evident.

However, the same fundamental mechanisms and factors determine behavior of both inorganic soils and fibrous peats. Fibrous peat deposits possess very high initial permeability, typically 1,000 times the initial permeability of soft clay and silt deposits. Upon compression, the permeability of fibrous peats decreases dramatically, with a ratio of permeability change index to in situ void ratio equal to 0.25, as compared to 0.50 for soft clay and silt deposits. Fibrous peats display extreme compressibility to the increase in effective vertical stress, with compression index values right after preconsolidation pressure 5 to 20 times the corresponding compressibility of typical soft clay and silt deposits. Among geotechnical materials, fibrous peats display the highest ratios of secondary compression index to compression index, in the range of 0.05 to 0.07. The values of coefficient of earth pressure at rest for normally consolidated young fibrous peat deposits are in the range of 0.30 to 0.35, as compared to 0.45 to 0.65 for inorganic soils.

The transport of trace elements is often studied by monitoring their accumulation in mosses. The aim of this study was to characterise and describe the distribution of deposited trace elements transported over long and intermediate distances in north-eastern France, a location far from the main emission sources. We analysed the trace element accumulation in <i>Sphagnum capillifolium </i>in 54 ombrotrophic peatlands distributed in six regions of France (Alps, Jura, Massif Central, Morvan, Rhône corridor and Vosges). The concentrations of Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Ti, V, and Zn in the surface were determined in three replicate samples of Sphagnum within each peatland. The enrichment factors calculated using Ti as the element of reference clearly exhibited a predominant anthropogenic origin for Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn, although the concentrations were relatively low compared to those found in other studies. The isolation of the peatlands from any fixed and traffic emission source suggests an intermediate and/or long-distance transport of the pollutants from their emission sources. The structure of the compositional dataset was explored using a covariance biplot. The first score was used as a synthetic indicator of the origin of the deposits and the degree of contamination of each peatland. This new index showed that the Vosges and the Alps were the regions most affected by high enrichment of trace elements, particularly Pb and Cd. The erosion of soils highly contaminated by former mining and smelting activities in the Vosges and the polluted cities and busy highways in the Alps may account for these distributions. The Jura was the least affected region sampled, and the other regions presented intermediate anthropogenic deposits.

It may be helpful for protection and monitoring changes in species diversity caused by artificial regulation of hydrology, atmospheric deposition, and global change. We took a data-driven approach to explore the potential of airborne hyperspectral data in determining plant associations of treeless northern boreal peatlands in Finland (65°57′N, 24°29′E). The objective was to produce an ecological peatland classification on a class hierarchical level which would be as detailed as possible, and could be accurately mapped with remotely sensed hyperspectal data. The proper hierarchical class level was decided based on statistical approaches including canonical correspondence analysis, unsupervised classification, and multivariate analysis of variance. Subsequently, fuzzy classification with support vector machines was applied to map the classes in the spatial domain from airborne geo- and atmospherically corrected hyperspectal HyMap data. We conducted detailed in situ sampling for surface plant inventory, soil root zone bulk dielectric permittivity (ε), electrical conductivity (σ), and pH. Constrained canonical correspondence ordination revealed that ε, σ (p<0.01), and pH (p<0.001) were significantly correlated with the ordination and were thus important drivers for vegetation composition. Four biotopes were distinguishable by their spectra: Sphagnum fuscum–Emperum nigrum–Rubus chamaemorus–S. angustifolium-bog, Eriophorum vaginatum–S. lindenbergii-sedge fen, eutrophic Carex lasiocarpa–Trichophorum cespitosum-fen, and Comarum palustre–S. majus–Carex rostrata-swamp. The highest overall efficiencies of prediction (overall accuracy 87.8%, kappa 0.781) were calculated using only 10% of the original training data indicating that low numbers of properly selected training sites from class boundaries could be appropriate for the support vector machines. The class specific assessment of accuracy with receiver operating characteristics curves also confirmed moderate-to-good successes of the approach with area under the curve values: 0.946 for bog, 0.951 for sedge fen, and 0.999 for eutrophic fen. Clusters of spectrally separable cohesive communities existed but they gradually changed from one plant association to another. Thus fuzzy mapping from hyperspectral and possible complementary data with well performing support vector machines could be justified in spatially continuous inventory and monitoring of boreal peatlands at regional, landscape or national scales.","2012-09-01","2025-01-08 20:46:54","2025-03-12 18:18:56","","596-609","","","124","","Remote Sens.

Fire management agencies require information about near-real time wildfire vulnerability in boreal peatlands. Remote sensing tools (e.g., NDVI, NDII) used to monitor changing wildfire vulnerability focus on monitoring changes in vascular vegetation and are not necessarily applicable to moss -dominated peatlands. We use time series analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data to compare the trends in peatlands that have burned to unburned peatlands and show that the Theil-Sen slopes of seasonally decomposed SAR backscatter reflects prolonged drought conditions that can lead to burning. Seasonally decomposed Sentinel -2 NDVI and NDII were also tested but no statistical differences were found between burned and unburned peatlands. Overall, we found that 6 months prior to a wildfire the slope of seasonally decomposed Sentinel-1 VV SAR backscatter was significantly different in burned and unburned peatlands, and can be used to spatially identify fire vulnerability and identify fire-prone areas.","2022-12-15","2025-01-08 20:46:54","2025-03-12 18:19:27","","","","","283","","Remote Sens.

The treed poor fens consistently had decreased moss cover and productivity with drainage. Across all sites, changes in understory community composition were related to the change in water table position as well as overstory canopy development that occurred post-drainage. Overall, drainage induced a shift toward a drier peatland regime, favoring increased canopy and vascular plant density at the expense of ground-layer mosses or the understory. Within the ground layer communities, drainage favored dry-adapted hummock moss and lichen species over those wet-adapted but dessication-prone species typical of low-lying lawns and hollows.

Research has shown that tile Hg methylation reaction is dependent on the availability of SO4 (as an electron acceptor) because SO4-reducing bacteria (SRB) mediate the biotic methylation of Hg. Much less research has investigated the possible organic C limitations to Hg methylation (i.e. from tile perspective of tile electron donor). Although peatlands are long-term stores of organic C, the C derived from peatland vegetation is of questionable microbial lability. This research investigated how both SO4 and organic C control net MeHg production using a controlled factorial addition design in 44 in situ peatland mesocosms. Two levels Of SO4 addition and energetic-equivalcnt additions (i.e. same number of electrons) of a number of organic C sources were used including glucose, acetate, lactate, coniferous litter leachate, and deciduous litter leachate. This study supports previous research demonstrating the stimulation of MeHg production from SO4 input alone (similar to 200 pg/L/day). None of the additions of organic C alone resulted in significant MeHg production. The combined addition of SO4 and some organic C sources resulted in considerably more MeHg production (similar to 500 pg/L/day) than did the addition Of SO4 alone, demonstrating that the highest levels of MeHg production can be expected only where fluxes of both SO4 and organic C are delivered concurrently. When compared to a number of pore water samples taken from two nearby peatlands, MeHg concentrations resulting from the combined addition of SO4 and organic C in this study were similar to MeHg ""hot spots"" found near the upland-peat land interface. The formation of MeHg ""hot spots"" at tile upland-peatland interface may be dependent on concurrent inputs of SO4 and organic C in runoff from the adjacent upland hillslopes.","2008-03","2025-01-08 20:46:55","2025-02-10 13:46:39","","503-518","","3","23","","Appl.

Total mercury (THg) and MeHg in peat pore waters were studied in four peatlands in spring, summer, and fall 2005. Marked spatial variability in the distribution of MeHg, and %MeHg as a proxy for net MeHg production, was observed, with highest values occurring in discrete zones. We denote these zones ""MeHg hot spots"", defined as an area where the pore water %MeHg exceeded the 90th percentile of the data set (n = 463) or >22% of THg as MeHg. MeHg hot spots occurred near the interface between peatland and the upland watershed with few exceptions. The %MeHg in pore water was significantly less in peatland interiors compared to upland-peatland interface zones, with the significance of these differences related to the delineation of the boundary between the two areas. Although further research is necessary, our data suggest that the occurrence of MeHg hot spots is related to the transport of solutes in upland runoff to the peatland perimeter and not to the accumulation of MeHg in this zone as a result of transport from either the peatland interior or the surrounding upland watershed. These findings augment the understanding of peatland MeHg production in upland-peatland watersheds, provide guidance for more accurate quantification of MeHg pool sizes in the landscape, and a spatial framework for the further study of mercury methylation processes in peatlands.","2008-02","2025-01-08 20:46:55","2025-03-12 01:42:02","","1010-1016","","4","42","","Environ.

In recent research, it was suggested that MeHg production and/or accumulation ""hot spots"" at the upland-peatland interface were the result of upland fluxes of sulfate and labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the peatland margin. Along the upland-peatland interface, spatial heterogeneity of ""hot spots"" was thought to be a result of variations in upland hydrologic interaction with the peatland margin. This hypothesis was tested in this study. Pore water MeHg, sulfate, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were compared in peatland plots at the base of both topographically concave and linear upland subcatcments in Minnesota. Subcatchment contributing areas were 3-8 times larger in the peatland plots adjacent to areas of concave upland topography. Peat pore water MeHg concentrations were significantly higher in these plots. Fluxes of water, sulfate, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the upland hillslope into the peatland margin were also generally much larger than those from below areas of concave upland topography. Taken together, these results suggest that watershed geomorphology plays an important role in controlling chemical fluxes into peatland margins and consequently MeHg production and accumulation. It may thus be possible to delineate areas of high MeHg production and/or accumulation in certain watersheds by using high-resolution topographic data. The resulting MeHg ""hot spots"" may be important for locally foraging biota and for downstream loading, especially in the spring and fall.","2009-02","2025-01-08 20:46:55","2025-03-12 01:42:04","","","","","45","","Water Resour.

Initially, a meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the status of RS-based wetland studies in terms of the wetland classification systems, methods, classes, RS data usage, publication details (e.g., authors, keywords, citations, and publications time), geographic information, and level of classification accuracies. The deep systematic review of 128 peer-reviewed articles illustrated the rising trend in using multi-source RS datasets along with advanced machine learning algorithms for wetland mapping in Canada. It was also observed that most of the studies were implemented over the province of Ontario. Pixel-based supervised classifiers were the most popular wetland classification algorithms. This review summarizes different RS systems and methodologies for wetland mapping in Canada to outline how RS has been utilized for the generation of wetland inventories.

These sites represented five major wetland ecosystems along a successional gradient from the coast inland. Measurements were made at approximate to 10-day intervals from early June to mid-August, and once in mid-September and mid-October 1990. Seasonal CH, fluxes were small (< 2 g m(-2)) at the recently emerged coastal marsh, coastal fen, tamarack fen, and interior fen ecosystems, except where there were shallow ponds and pools, which emitted 2 - 5 g CH4 m(-2). At the more complex bog ecosystem locations, CH4 fluxes were small (0.3 - 2.0 g m(-2)) from hummock/hollow microtopography in the raised bogs and from the forested margin. The largest CH4 fluxes were recorded from the degrading pest sections forming shallow pools and the moss/sedge mats which were always close to saturation (1.8 - 16.6 g m(-2)). A deeper (1-m water depth) peal emitted less CH4 (1.4 g m(-2)). In terms of ecological succession along the transect, covering emergence over approximate to 4000 yr, CH4 emission rates increase from marsh to fen and bog, primarily through the development of pest degradation and the formation of moss/sedge lawns and pools. There were very weak statistical relationships at each site between the daily CH4 flux and pest temperature and water table. However, there was a significant (r(2) = 0.44, p < 0.001) correlation between the seasonal CH4 flux and the mean position of the water table over the complete range of sites, emphasizing the overall importance of hydrology in determining CH4 flux. Laboratory incubation experiments were conducted to determine the capacity of the surface (0 - 20 cm depth) pest samples to produce CH4 anaerobically and consume CH4 aerobically. They revealed that many samples exhibited high CH4 consumption rates, suggesting that although CH4 production in the subsurface pest is high, CH4 emissions from these wetlands to the atmosphere are limited to a large extent by CH4 oxidation in the surface layers of the peat. Trophic status of the pest appeared to have little influence on emission rates, with the highest fluxes in the most acid (pH < 3.5) samples.","1994-01-20","2025-01-08 20:46:55","2025-03-07 21:59:21","","1455-1467","","D1","99","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4.4","2","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the methane emissions from a range of wetland and peatland types in the Hudson Bay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; peatland; other wetland; bog; greenhouse gases; carbon cycle; fen; Hudson Bay Lowland; saltmarsh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This technology is rapidly expanding and there is uncertainty whether ISDs restrict animal movement, leading to increased extinction probabilities for some wide-ranging species. Here we test for effects of simulated future (i.e., 50 years from now) and current ISDs on simulated movements of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus), a threatened species across North America. In simulations of future scenarios, we varied the spacing and permeability of ISDs and the presence/absence of protected areas. Permeability was measured as the number of times simulated caribou crossed ISDs with different levels of modelled permeability. We estimated the effects of these factors on caribou step length and annual home range size, key metrics of small and large spatiotemporal scales of movement, respectively. Current caribou crossings of above-ground pipeline features of ISDs were measured using camera traps and compared to expected caribou crossing rates based on present-day caribou movement simulations. Current crossing rates were evaluated within the context of predicted future crossing success rates necessary to maintain caribou step lengths and home ranges. With few exceptions, permeability across ISDs was the main factor affecting caribou movement, more so than spacing between developments or the presence of protected areas. However, minimal permeability (crossing rates of c. 15% to 60%, relative to an undisturbed site was needed to maintain existing home range size and step lengths. The effect of permeability on home range size and step length was non-linear, suggesting that small increases in permeability would provide a disproportionately greater benefit to caribou movement. Our predictions demonstrate that maintaining permeability across ISDs is more important than spacing between leases or including protected areas, and thus provides clear direction for mitigation efforts for features that will exist on the landscape for decades to come.","2015","2025-01-08 20:46:55","2025-03-12 01:41:41","","e0136933","","9","10","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.7","3","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the movement of woodland caribou across northern Alberta as a result of seismic lines produced for in-situ petroleum extraction.</p> </div>","","","Canada; species-at-risk; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; remote sensing; monitoring; impact minimization; caribou; caribou, boreal population; roads; mitigation hierarchy; pipelines; fauna; mammals; camera traps; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contemporary and past rates of atmospheric dust deposition were reconstructed using age-dated peat cores (210Pb and 14C) collected from five bogs in the vicinity of mines and upgraders and from two bogs far removed from industrial activities. The main objective of this study was to quantify the impact of industry on dust emissions, and to do this, the variation in natural “background” rates of mineral matter accumulation also had to be determined. A second objective was to characterize the size, mineralogical composition, and morphology of the particulate matter emitted to better understand potential environmental consequences of dust emissions. The concentrations of acid insoluble ash and Th (a surrogate for insoluble mineral matter) were determined to calculate dust accumulation rates. Scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis failed to reveal much variation in mineralogical composition, but near industry, the size of the particles was more variable. The abundance of fly ash particles increased with depth, which suggests that emissions from upgrader stacks may have declined over time. A comparison of acid-insoluble ash inventories with the pH of the porewaters suggests that the acid-soluble ash fraction of the dusts deposited may have impacted the chemical composition of the bog waters.

Animals can increase risk avoidance in response to fluctuations in predation risk, but questions remain regarding individual variability and the capacity to respond to changes in spatial risk across human-altered landscapes. In northeast British Columbia, Canada, boreal caribou populations declined as roads and seismic lines have increased, which are theorized to increase gray wolf predation. Our goal was to model risk and to evaluate individual variability and the development of risk perception by examining individual risk avoidance in response to reproductive status and age. We used locations from collared caribou and wolves to identify landscape features associated with the risk of a potential wolf-caribou encounter and risk of being killed given an encounter. We built resource selection functions to estimate individual responses to risk. We used general linear regressions to evaluate individual risk and linear feature avoidance as a function of age and reproductive status (calf or no calf). Linear features increased the risk of encounter. Older caribou and caribou with calves demonstrated stronger avoidance of the risk of encounter and roads, but weaker avoidance in late summer to the risk of being killed relative to younger and calf-less individuals. Mechanisms explaining the inverse relationships between the risk of encounter and risk of being killed are uncertain, but it is conceivable that caribou learn to avoid the risk of encounter and roads. Responses by females with vulnerable calves to the risk of encounter and risk of being killed might be explained by a trade-off between these two risk types and a prioritization on the risk of encounter. Despite the capacity to alter their responses to risk, the global decline in Rangifer populations (caribou and wild reindeer) suggests these behaviors are insufficient to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances.","2017-12","2025-01-08 20:46:56","2025-03-12 01:49:54","","10266-10277","","23","7","","Ecol.

Spatial responses to linear features vary depending on local conditions (functional responses), including linear feature availability. Several studies explored functional responses of wildlife to linear features, but few examined responses of multiple interacting species. Objectives We evaluated functional responses of Threatened boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), moose (Alces alces), and gray wolves (Canis lupus) to roads and seismic lines (linear features created during fossil fuel exploration) to assess the influence these responses might have on predator-prey interactions. Methods We estimated median distance to and the density of roads and seismic lines around used and available locations by landcover (peatlands and non-peatlands) and season for each individual. To quantify functional responses, we regressed use in response to availability in peatlands and non-peatlands across seasons and selected the most parsimonious models for each species. Results Boreal caribou generally avoided higher road density. Wolves selected areas closer to roads in peatlands and demonstrated selection or indifference to higher road density as availability increased. Female moose generally avoided areas with higher road density, except in early winter. Female caribou and moose demonstrated weaker responses to seismic line density. During calving, late summer, and early winter, wolves often selected for seismic line density, particularly in peatlands, when availability was high. Conclusions Our analyses suggest that boreal caribou, moose, and wolves respond to linear features in complex ways that alter individual space-use and likely influence predation risk.","2019-11","2025-01-08 20:46:56","2025-03-12 01:49:51","","2575-2597","","11","34","","Landscape Ecol.","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.2","2","SC: None[s0]","<p>- This paper examines the response of multiple large prey and predator species to the landscape pattern of linear disturbances, here seismic lines and forest roads.</p>","","","species-at-risk; linear disturbance; linear feature; seismic lines; caribou; caribou, boreal population; moose; predation; roads; timber wolf; mineral exploration; fauna; mammals; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most-cited mechanism by which disturbance threatens boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) is the exacerbation of apparent competition via increases in early successional forage, and subsequent changes in the densities and distributions of other prey species and gray wolves (Canis lupus). An alternative mechanism is the direct alteration of wolf distribution via positive responses by wolves to anthropogenic features. We conducted a mechanistic evaluation of hypotheses explaining human-mediated increases in boreal caribou mortality across northeast British Columbia. We evaluated support for (i) numeric apparent competition (increased prey densities) by evaluating relationships between disturbances, moose (Alces aloes) density, and caribou survival. To evaluate (ii) spatial apparent competition (altered prey distribution) and (iii) wolf spatial responses (altered wolf distribution independent of prey), we modeled the relationships between disturbances and indices of caribou-moose and caribou-wolf co-occurrence and then examined predation risk for caribou as a function of co-occurrence. We did not detect any relationships between anthropogenic disturbances, moose density, and caribou survival. Although caribou-moose co-occurrence increased predation risk, we observed both positive and negative relationships between disturbances and caribou-moose co-occurrence. In contrast, caribou-wolf co-occurrence increased predation risk and was positively correlated with anthropogenic linear features. Contrary to other boreal caribou populations, our analyses demonstrate stronger support for the direct effects of anthropogenic linear features on caribou-wolf spatial overlap, leading to greater risk for caribou. Our research highlights the need for region-specific management actions to conserve and recover widely distributed species.","2018-12","2025-01-08 20:46:56","2025-03-12 01:49:50","","215-223","","","228","","Biol.

Relative percent cover and species richness of vascular and non-vascular plants significantly increased with distance into the wetland, with higher non-vascular richness being found at intermediate distances before transitioning to a vascular plant dominated community. Bacterial and archaeal community composition exhibited a decreased proportion of members of the phylum Acidobacteria (notably of the order Acidobacteriales) and increased diversity and richness of methanogens across a larger range of orders farther from the tailings source, an indication of microbial C-cycling potential. Consistent with changes in microbial communities, in vitro microbial CH4 production potential significantly increased with distance from the contaminant source.

Ten years of drainage in the bog significantly increased coverage of shrubs at hummocks and lichens at hollows.

Knowledge of carbon cycling and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics, including methane (CH4), is one way to understand the biogeochemical function of newly constructed fen ecosystems. In this study we monitored CH4 emissions and CH4 pore water concentration, as well as ecological and soil chemistry controls on CH4 emissions and pore water concentration, from a constructed fen. The same variables were also monitored at two natural reference fens that had similar vascular vegetation to the constructed fen. Methane emissions were lower at the constructed fen compared to the reference poor fen, but similar to the reference saline fen. However, CH4 concentration in pore water at 0.2 m and 0.7 m depth was lower at the constructed fen than either of the natural reference sites. The supply rate of sulfur (all mobile forms) was the most dominant control on CH4 emission and CH4 pore water concentration. While low CH4 emissions may be beneficial for constructed fens from a GHG perspective, this condition indicates that peat and carbon accumulation at these reclaimed sites may ensue slowly. Therefore, a clear statement of goals is required to determine how CH4 dynamics from constructed fen ecosystems relate to the reclamation outcome. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2025-01-08 20:46:56","2025-03-11 18:46:06","","369-381","","","583","","Sci.

Here, we provide a comprehensive review of pre- and post-fire hydrological and ecological interactions that affect the likelihood of peatland burning, address the connections between peatland fires and the C-climate cycle, and provide a conceptual model of peatland processes as they relate to wildland fire, hydro-climate, and ecosystem change. Despite negative ecohydrological feedback mechanisms that may compensate for increased C loss initially, the cumulative effects of climatic warming, anthropogenic peatland fragmentation, and subsequent peatland drying will increase C loss to the atmosphere, driving a positive C feedback cycle. However, the extent to which negative and positive feedbacks will compensate for one another and the timelines for each remains unclear.

Previous studies are based upon point measurements of vegetation moisture content and water table position, and therefore a detailed moisture status of entire northern peatlands is not available. Consequently, upscaling ground and remotely sensed data to the desired spatial resolutions is inevitable. This study continues our previous investigation of the impact of various moisture conditions of common sub-Arctic lichen and moss species (i.e., Cladina stellaris, Cladina rangiferina, Dicranum elongatum, and Tomenthypnum nitens) upon the spectral signatures obtained in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada. Upscaling reflectance measurements of the above species were conducted in the field, and reflectance analysis using a singularity index was made, since this study serves as a basis for future aircraft/satellite research. An attempt to upscale current and new spectral reflectance indices developed in our previous studies was made as well. Our findings indicate that the spectral index C. rangiferina is to a lesser amount influenced by scale since it has a small R-2 values between the log of the index and the log of the resolution, reduced slopes between the log of the index and the log of the resolution, and similar slopes between log reflectance and log resolution (alpha) of two wavelengths employed by the index.

This study investigates the impact of various moisture conditions of the lichens Cladina stellaris and Cladina rangiferina, and the mosses Dicranum elongatum and Tomenthypnum nitens on the spectral signatures obtained. Reflectance and moisture content measurements of these species were made in a laboratory setting, while maintaining the natural moisture conditions of the samples; once the moisture and spectral measurements were complete, the samples were returned to the field and placed in their natural setting, continuously receiving moisture from precipitation and groundwater and losing water through evaporation and drainage. Previously, we correlated the present spectral indices with the moisture contents of the above species, whereas the current study developed new species-specific indices to improve the detection of the plants' moisture contents. The relationship between the plants' moisture content and the water table position was examined as well. It was found that the lichens are not responsive to variations in the water table position, whereas the mosses, specifically D. elongatum, are quite sensitive to changes in the water table position. Thus, the use of the mosses spectral indices may contribute to an indirect evaluation of the water table position. Overall, the results suggest that the unique spectral signatures of the above species can be detected by satellite and airborne imagery, whereas the mosses, can be used as indicators of peatlands moisture status.

Part of their decline has been attributed to increasing densities of anthropogenic linear features such as trails, roads, railways, and hydro lines. These features have been shown to increase the search efficiency and kill rate of wolves. However, it is unclear whether selection for anthropogenic linear features is additive or compensatory to selection for natural (water) linear features which may also be used for travel. We studied the selection of water and anthropogenic linear features by 52 resident wolves (Canis lupusx lycaon) over four years across three study areas in northern Ontario that varied in degrees of forestry activity and human disturbance. We used Euclidean distance -based resource selection functions (mixed -effects logistic regression) at the seasonal range scale with random coefficients for distance to water linear features, primary/secondary roads/railways, and hydro lines, and tertiary roads to estimate the strength of selection for each linear feature and for several habitat types, while accounting for availability of each feature. Next, we investigated the trade-off between selection for anthropogenic and water linear features. Wolves selected both anthropogenic and water linear features; selection for anthropogenic features was stronger than for water during the rendezvous season. Selection for anthropogenic linear features increased with increasing density of these features on the landscape, while selection for natural linear features declined, indicating compensatory selection of anthropogenic linear features. These results have implications for woodland caribou conservation. Prey encounter rates between wolves and caribou seem to be strongly influenced by increasing linear feature densities. This behavioral mechanism a compensatory functional response to anthropogenic linear feature density resulting in decreased use of natural travel corridors has negative consequences for the viability of woodland caribou.","2017-11","2025-01-08 20:46:57","2025-03-12 01:49:52","","","","11","12","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.7","3","SC: None[s0]","<p>- This paper examines the preferential use of linear disturbances by wolves in the Boreal Shield and Hudson Plains regions of northern Ontario.<br/></p>","","","Canada; species-at-risk; Ontario; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; caribou; caribou, boreal population; predation; roads; timber wolf; Boreal Shield; pipelines; fauna; mammals; Hudson Bay Lowland; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there currently exists limited guidance for incorporating direct, indirect, and induced effects to wetlands in impact assessment and mitigation planning for small and often routine developments, including access roads or highway improvement initiatives. Based on the Louis Riel Trail, Highway 11 North twinning project in Saskatchewan, Canada, this article demonstrates a methodological approach and decision support framework for assessing and managing direct, indirect, and induced effects to wetlands from linear developments. No regulatory-based environmental assessment was required for the highway project; effects were deemed to be insignificant under current wetland mitigation practices. However, our results show that 1115 ha of potentially affected wetlands are located within a 500 m impact zone on either side of the proposed highway. More than 50 percent of these wetlands are seasonal, less than 1 ha in size, and typically not included in mitigation planning. An expert-based multi-criteria evaluation of impact and mitigation options for wetlands in the study area indicated “no net loss” as a planning priority, and a preference for a spatially ambitious mitigation plan focused on direct, indirect, and potentially induced impacts. In practice, however, mitigation is often restrictive, focused on mitigating only direct impacts within the project's right-of-way, in this case less than 50 ha of wetlands, resulting in the potential for significant net loss of wetland habitat and function. If the risk to wetlands is to be given due consideration in project planning and development for roads and road improvement initiatives, then structured assessment methods and decision support frameworks should be sensitive to the time and resource constraints of small projects and screening-type assessments. This requires also that wetland mitigation policies are developed and implementation plans formulated as part of project planning and assessment initiatives for linear developments.","2012","2025-01-08 20:46:57","2025-02-25 14:16:49","","117-139","","1","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents an expert-based evaluation of impact and mitigation options for wetlands in central Saskatchewan.

Ensuring no net loss of wetlands requires consideration of the direct, indirect, and potentially induced effects of development; however, many projects that affect wetlands are often deemed insignificant and do not trigger any formal environmental assessment process. When such small scale or routine projects are assessed, indirect and induced effects, and in particular effects to small or seasonal wetlands, are often not included in impact assessment and subsequent wetland mitigation. As a result, mitigation of the total or cumulative effects to wetlands is often insufficient or completely lacking in development planning and impact assessment. Part of the problem is that there currently exists only limited guidance as to how to identify effects to wetlands in project planning and environmental assessment for relatively routine, small-scale projects. In response, this paper presents a methodological framework for the integration of effects to wetlands in project planning and environmental assessment application. Focused on effects to wetlands from linear developments, in particular transportation corridors, a four-phase, nine-step assessment framework is developed to provide guidance to effects assessment for wetlands during the early stages of project planning. The framework will aid practitioners and regulators in identifying the potential effects of a project to wetlands, and in determining the acceptability of impact management practices. Although situated in the Canadian context, the framework and principles are broadly applicable in other jurisdictions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","2011","2025-01-08 20:46:57","2025-02-25 14:09:45","","133-140","","2","99","","Landscape Urban Plann.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>- This paper presents a framework to examine and mitigate the impacts of linear disturbances on wetlands in general.</p>","","","Canada; linear disturbance; linear feature; other wetland; transmission lines; impact avoidance; impact minimization; roads; mitigation hierarchy; pipelines; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They facilitate the accumulation of carbon in peat deposits, but climate change is predicted to expose peatland ecosystem to sustained and unprecedented warming leading to a significant release of carbon to the atmosphere. Sphagnum responses to climate change, and their interaction with other components of the ecosystem, will determine the future trajectory of carbon fluxes in peatlands. We measured the growth and productivity of Sphagnum in an ombrotrophic bog in northern Minnesota, where ten 12.8-m-diameter plots were exposed to a range of whole-ecosystem (air and soil) warming treatments (+0 to +9°C) in ambient or elevated (+500 ppm) CO2. The experiment is unique in its spatial and temporal scale, a focus on response surface analysis encompassing the range of elevated temperature predicted to occur this century, and consideration of an effect of co-occurring CO2 altering the temperature response surface. In the second year of warming, dry matter increment of Sphagnum increased with modest warming to a maximum at 5°C above ambient and decreased with additional warming. Sphagnum cover declined from close to 100% of the ground area to <50% in the warmest enclosures. After three years of warming, annual Sphagnum productivity declined linearly with increasing temperature (13–29 g C/m2 per °C warming) due to widespread desiccation and loss of Sphagnum. Productivity was less in elevated CO2 enclosures, which we attribute to increased shading by shrubs. Sphagnum desiccation and growth responses were associated with the effects of warming on hydrology. The rapid decline of the Sphagnum community with sustained warming, which appears to be irreversible, can be expected to have many follow-on consequences to the structure and function of this and similar ecosystems, with significant feedbacks to the global carbon cycle and climate change.","2019","2025-01-08 20:46:57","2025-03-07 18:27:28","","12571-12585","","22","9","","Ecol.

Nine plots located in European Northeast and treated using various bioremediation methods were monitored from 2002 to 2014. Geobotanical descriptions (relevés) of each plot were performed in 2006 and 2014, and Grime’s theoretical CSR (competition–stress–ruderality) framework was used to assess the vegetation state and dynamics. We observed a clear shift of communities from pioneer (where ruderal species were prevalent) to stable (where competitor species were dominant) states. However, the remediation type did not significantly impact the vegetation recovery rate. After 12 years, all methods led to a 55–90% decrease in the oil content of the soil and a recovery of the vegetation cover. The plant communities contained mainly cereals and sedges which significantly differed from the original tundra communities before the oil spill. The control plot, treated only by mechanical cleaning, had minimum oil degradation rate (50%) and vegetation recovery rates, although, in CSR terms, its vegetation assemblage resembled the background community. Cereals (Agrostis gigantea, Deschampsia cespitosa, Phalaris arundinacea, and Poa pratensis), sedges (Carex canescens, Carex limosa, and Eriophorum vaginatum), and shrubs (Salix) were found to be the most effective species for phytoremediation, exhibiting high community productivity under the harsh northern conditions.","2021-03-01","2025-01-08 20:46:57","2025-03-07 18:20:55","","4888","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4.6","3","SC: 0000022","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the phytoremediation of hydrocarbons in oil spilled peatland and the long-term effect on vegetation.</p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; bog; pollution; spills; invasive species; mitigation hierarchy; bio/phytoremediation; hydrocarbons; functional types; remediation; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The treatments involved running the machines in selected extraction racks (i.e., 3 m wide machine routes) while conducting normal wood thinning and extraction operations comprising one and two passes by the harvester and the forwarder with full payload, respectively. Soil disturbance thresholds were established by testing the level of significance of the difference in induced soil damage and compaction before and after machine traffic treatments. For volumetric soil water content lying between 10.0 and 14.9%, threshold cone penetration resistance levels for two 600/55-30.5 tyres were found to range from 594 to 640 kPa for deep-raised peat soil with initial strength lying between 524 and 581 kPa. In general, the proportion of the total rut depth data in each rack that exceeded the threshold level of 21.5 cm was about 5%. The threshold value corresponds to sinkage equivalent to 15% of the overall wheel diameter of the harvester, above which machine mobility would be hampered considerably.

Restoration, through re-wetting and revegetation, aims to return the C sink function by re-establishing conditions similar to that of an undrained peatland. However, the time needed to re-establish C sequestration is not well constrained due to the lack of multi-year measurements. We measured over 3 years the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), methane (), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at a restored post-extraction peatland (RES) in southeast Canada (restored 14 years prior to the start of the study) and compared our observations to the C balance of an intact reference peatland (REF) that has a long-term continuous flux record and is in the same climate zone. Small but significant differences in winter respiration driven by temperature were mainly responsible for differences in cumulative NEE between years. Low growing season inter-annual variability was linked to constancy of the initial spring water table position, controlled by the blocked drainage ditches and the presence of water storage structures (bunds and pools). Half-hour at RES was small except when <i>Typha latifolia</i>-invaded drainage ditches were in the tower footprint; this effect at the ecosystem level was small as ditches represent a minor fraction of RES. The restored peatland was an annual sink for CO2 (−90 ± 18 g C m−2 year−1), a source of CH4 (4.4 ± 0.2 g C m−2 year−1), and a source of DOC (6.9 ± 2.2 g C m−2 year−1), resulting in mean net ecosystem uptake of 78 ± 17 g C m−2 year−1. Annual NEE at RES was most similar to wetter, more productive years at REF. Integrating structures to increase water retention, alongside re-establishing key species, have been effective at re-establishing the net C sink rate to that of an intact peatland.","2018","2025-01-08 20:46:58","2025-03-07 18:20:55","","5751-5768","","12","24","","Global Change Biol.","","","","","","","","","","","","","11.6","1","SC: 0000124","<p>- This paper demonstrates that peatlands can be restored toward a carbon sink within 14 years of peatland restoration using the moss layer transfer technique.</p>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; substrate disturbance; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These changes have important implications for northern ecosystems, including shifting controls on carbon uptake and release functions, as well as altering evapotranspiration (ET) rates, which form feedbacks with climatic change. Four landforms (peat plateau, sedge lawn, channel fen, and a thermokarst shoreline collapse scar) in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, northern Manitoba, were instrumented for weekly chamber measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor flux over a summer season (May to September 2014). Relative to other landforms, thermokarst CO2 exchange was characterized by high respiration rates early in the season, which decreased and were offset later in the season by CO2 uptake driven by sedge productivity. For all landforms, ET peaked post-snowmelt during rapid active layer thaw, and decreased throughout the growing season, controlled primarily by atmospheric vapor deficits. This work shows distinct differences in CO2 exchange and ET between intact and thawing permafrost features.

Dynamic surface water products generated from historical Landsat data exist to inform surface water trends in the HBL based on binary classifications of land vs water at 30 m spatial resolution. However, the HBL contains many water features smaller than 30 m, including streams and patterned fens that require a sub-pixel mapping approach to fully capture their dynamics. In this paper, we leverage an existing binary dynamic surface water product to generate a spatially and temporally comprehensive Landsat sub-pixel surface water time-series over the HBL. We first generate Landsat Red, NIR and SWIR composites from 1985 to 2021 and evaluate data-driven machine learning and physical models to derive sub-30 m water fractions across the entire mapping domain. Data-driven models were calibrated on 30 m water fractions obtained from 16 of 17 WorldView scene water fraction maps and assessed on the 17th held-out scene in a jackknife validation. Data-driven models were also calibrated by relating scaled Landsat reflectance to water fractions obtained from binary water masks at corresponding scales from 90 to 270 m. Physical models involved simple linear unmixing using a new approach that samples land endmembers in the vicinity of each pixel to represent land reflectance, and a global water endmember sampled beneath permanent water in each image. The assumption of linear scaling was verified at sub-30 m to 270 m resolution for NIR, SWIR and NDVI, which were all highly correlated with water fraction and had no significant differences among water fraction - spectral feature relationships across the full range of scales. Each of 11 different methods and input spectral features were evaluated against WorldView water fractions and ranked based on nine criteria. We found that machine learning using all spectral features including local NIR land endmembers performed best among data-driven approaches, and linear unmixing of the NIR band using local land endmembers performed best among physical. Both best performing methods were applied to the entire time-series and surface water area trends were calculated and compared with trends obtained from binary water masks. All three methods agree on the direction of surface water change towards wetting, with sub-pixel inter-annual variation agreeing with stream discharge noted in other studies.","2024-01-01","2025-01-08 20:46:58","2025-03-07 18:21:41","","","","","300","","Remote Sens.

Wetlands are lands that are seasonally or permanently flooded by shallow water, as well as lands where the water table is close to or at the surface. In either case, the presence of abundant water has caused the formation of hydric (moist) soils and has favoured the dominance of either hydrophytic (water-loving) or water tolerant plants. The term wetland is a general one and includes specific land types commonly called marshes, bogs, swamps and fens. Periodically soaked or wetlands being used for agricultural purposes that no longer exhibit wetland characteristics are not considered to be wetlands for the purposes of this definition. Wetland polygons are mapped independently from other hydrographic data classes and may overlap water bodies or other hydrographic data. Not all wetlands have been identified and mapped. Active maintenance is ongoing province-wide. Evaluators using the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) will find additional guidance on the Ontario Wetlands evaluation page.

With forecasts for warmer and drier conditions over the next century, the relative contribution of water from surface and subsurface sources affecting both water quantity and quality will undoubtedly shift. Unfortunately, no empirical data exist for any streams or rivers of the HBL on the relative contributions of surface water and groundwater to streamflow, making assessment of future change difficult. Here we report the first data on sources of water to streams and rivers across a range of catchment sizes in the James Bay Lowland (JBL) ecoregion of the HBL. Solute chemistry was determined for a range of potential end members, end members were identified, and a chemical mixing model approach was used to determine the relative end-member contributions to streamflow across a range of catchment sizes (similar to 30-2000 km(2)). The relative contributions of bedrock-derived groundwater to streamflow increased with catchment area from <20 to >40% under dry conditions, and were similar to 50% lower under wet conditions across all catchments. Runoff contributions from peatlands were relatively constant over space and time (53-67%), but the fraction of streamflow composed of rain and snowmelt varied dramatically between wet and dry periods, and among catchments. Given the importance of peatland-derived surface waters, future changes in precipitation and temperature could have significant implications for streamflow in the JBL, particularly during summer base-flow conditions. Moreover, the definition of reference catchments for baseline/impact monitoring must be carefully considered, given the potential for variation in hydrochemistry across physiographically similar catchments.","2014-02","2025-01-08 20:47:00","2025-03-12 01:56:43","","236-250","","1","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","4","SC: 0000047","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper attempts to quantify the contributions of surface water and groundwater to watercourses in the Hudson Bay Lowlands.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; biogeochemistry; hydrology; peatland; monitoring; surface water/runoff; watercourses; Hudson Bay Lowland; reference conditions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2009, Syncrude Canada Ltd. began construction of the 52 ha Sandhill Fen pilot watershed, including a 15 ha, hydrologically managed fen peatland built on sand-capped soft oil sands tailings. An integral component of fen reclamation is post-construction monitoring of water quality, including salinity, fluvial carbon, and priority pollutant elements. In this study, the effects of fen reclamation and elevated sulfate levels on mercury (Hg) fate and transport in the constructed system were assessed. Total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in the fen sediment were lower than in two nearby natural fens, which may be due to the higher mineral content of the Sandhill Fen peat mix and/or a loss of Hg through evasion during the peat harvesting, stockpiling and placement processes. Porewater MeHg concentrations in the Sandhill Fen typically did not exceed 1.0 ng L (super -1) . The low MeHg concentrations may be a result of elevated porewater sulfate concentrations (mean 346 mg L (super -1) ) and an increase in sulphide concentrations with depth in the peat, which are known to suppress MeHg production. Total Hg and MeHg concentrations increased during a controlled mid-summer flooding event where the water table rose above the ground surface in most of the fen. The Hg dynamics during this event showed that hydrologic fluctuations in this system exacerbate the release of THg and MeHg downstream. In addition, the elevated SO (sub 4) (super 2-) concentrations in the peat porewaters may become a problem with respect to downstream MeHg production once the fen is hydrologically connected to a larger wetland network that is currently being constructed.","2016","2025-01-08 20:47:00","2025-03-08 14:23:49","","628-637","","","213","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8.9","2","SC: 0000029","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the total and methylmercury concentrations in a constructed fen for mine reclamation in the Alberta oil sands region.

The fate of peatland C stores and related climate system feedbacks remain uncertain under scenarios of a changing climate and enhanced anthropogenic pressure. Here, we present a synthesis of Holocene peatland C dynamics for the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), Canada, in relation to the past atmospheric CH4 trends, glacial isostatic adjustment, and paleoclimate. We report that peatland age and trophic status, together with paleoclimate, contribute to explaining some of the temporal variation in C accumulation rates (CARs) in the HBL. Our results show that younger, minerotrophic peatlands accumulate C faster, and although detailed paleoclimate data are not available, the results suggest the possibility of higher CARs in association with warmer Holocene climates. Peat initiation rates and CARs were greatest during the mid-Holocene; however, our results reveal that two-thirds of the HBL C pool is stored in peat of late Holocene age, owing to long-term peatland expansion and development. Whereas the HBL has been a net C sink since mid-Holocene peat initiation, the HBL also appears to have been a modest C source, with 85% of the losses occurring during the late Holocene as a consequence of the gradual decay of previously accrued peat. Late Holocene peat decay, under wetter climatic conditions, and from a landscape occupied by an abundance of minerotrophic peatlands, indicates that the HBL may have been a natural terrestrial source of CH4 to the late Holocene atmosphere. While the peatlands of the HBL may continue to function as a globally significant C store, ongoing C losses from the HBL may have important implications for the global C budget and climate system.","2014-09","2025-01-08 20:47:00","2025-03-07 21:59:20","","1063-1074","","9","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.4","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper uses a paleoecological approach to quantify the variability in carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas release over the long term in the Hudson Bay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; climate change; greenhouse gases; carbon sequestration; monitoring; carbon cycle; Hudson Bay Lowland; reference conditions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, our understanding of contributions from the world's second largest peatland, the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), Canada, to peat-climate-C-dynamics is constrained by the paucity of dated peat records and regional C-data. Here we examine HBL peatland development in relation to Holocene C-dynamics. We show that peat initiation in the HBL is tightly coupled with glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) through most of the record, and occurred within suitable climatic conditions for peatland development. HBL peatlands initiated most intensively in the mid-Holocene, when GIA was most rapid and climate was cooler and drier.

As a globally significant C sink, elucidation of controls on the distribution of C in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada (HBL), is of particular importance. Although peat age is related to timing of land emergence and peat depth in the HBL, considerable variation in the total C mass (kg m(-2)) among sites of similar peat age suggests that other factors may explain spatial patterns in C storage (Pg) and sequestration. Here we quantify the role of two key factors in explaining the spatial distribution of the C mass in the HBL (n = 364 sites), (i) climate variability and (ii) peat lithology, for two major peatland classes in the HBL (bogs and fens). We find that temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration each explained nearly half of the C mass variability. Regions characterized by warmer and wetter conditions stored the most C as peat. Our results show that bogs and fens store similar amounts of C within a given climate domain, although via distinct storage mechanisms. Namely, fen peats tend to be shallower and more C dense (kg m(-3)) compared to bogs. Following geophysical controls on the timing of peat initiation, our results reveal that both the widespread bog-fen patterning and variability in regional climate contribute to explaining the spatial distribution of the peat C mass in the HBL.","2016-04","2025-01-08 20:47:00","2025-03-12 01:56:39","","1104-1117","","4","121","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.7","2","SC: 0000031","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the spatial relations between peat types and climate and carbon sequestration in the Hudson Bay Lowland. </p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; peat; carbon sequestration; monitoring; carbon cycle; cold climate; Hudson Bay Lowland; reference conditions; substrate; climate; carbon storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pretreated process effluent and drainage waters containing high concentrations of e.g., arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), and nickel (Ni) have been purified for up to 6 years in treatment peatlands at a gold mine in Finnish Lappland prior to their release into downstream water bodies. Retention efficiencies based on monitoring of peatland inflow and outflow waters indicated that retention of As, Sb, and Ni was generally good (up to 95%) but temporarily variable. Other contaminants such as sulfate or iron were retained less efficiently or were even leaching from the peatland. Most of the As, Sb, and Ni was retained close to the wastewater distribution ditch, and there was a near-linear increase in As, Sb, and Ni concentrations in the peatlands over time. Adsorption experiments indicated the high potential of peat soils to adsorb As, Ni and especially Sb. Accumulation of contaminants has led to or will lead to concentrations exceeding higher guideline values for contaminated soils within the next 1-18 years, which indicates a limited lifetime for treatment peatlands. Leaching of contaminants is anticipated in situations where clean natural waters mix with mine waters, e.g., during snowmelt or after mine closure, and desorption experiments suggest that especially easily mobilized (i.e., loosely-bound) fractions of As, Sb, and Ni are likely to leach from the treatment peatlands. The collective data indicate (i) high purification efficiencies for As, Sb, and Ni in the peatlands, (ii) high adsorptive capacity of the peat soil for those contaminants, (iii) increased risk of contaminant leaching e.g., after mine closure, and (iv) a need for further studies of environmental parameters and retention processes affecting contaminant removal efficiencies and potential lifetimes of treatment peatlands. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","2015","2025-01-08 20:47:00","2025-03-07 22:06:56","","350-364","","","75","","Ecol.

The influence of bedrock and till composition, and subsequent groundwater and surface water quality, on the metal and sulfur concentrations in the peat deposits was evaluated. The peat samples at the non-mineralized mica schist study site M1 showed moderate increase in element concentrations (Cu, Ni, S) and decreasing electric conductivity (EC) as a function of depth, whereas at the mineralized black schist study sites M2 and M3 the heavy metal (Fe, Ni, Zn) and sulfur concentrations and EC exhibited a significant increase towards the Carex-dominated bottom layers. Besides anomalous metal (up to 12.0 wt.% Fe, 758 mg/kg Ni, 5270 mg/kg Zn) and S (13.6 wt.%) concentrations, the site M2 presented anomalously high ash content (median 35%) and low pH (3.4), which were attributed to the acid rock drainage derived from an adjacent mineralized black schist outcrop. Samples from site M2 were subjected to sequential extractions to study elemental distribution. The studied peatland is a natural analog to constructed wetlands in passive treatment of acid mine drainage waters, though the retention capacity is lower due to low pH and decreased buffering capacity.

High suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) were found in the drainage water at one particular site during the 2001–2002 spring seasons in New Brunswick (Canada). The main objective of this study was to verify this observation at other sites, compare SSC levels leaving harvested peat bogs with those leaving an unharvested bog, and to determine if high SSC events happen only in Spring or all year round. Suspended sediment concentrations were monitored downstream of three harvested peat bogs and an unharvested reference bog located in New Brunswick during the ice free seasons of 2003–2004. On average, SSC at the harvested sites exceeded 25 mg/l, which is the recommended daily maximum concentration, 72% of the time, while the same concentration was exceeded 30% of the time at the unharvested sites. SSC were found to be significantly higher at harvested sites than at the reference sites for all seasons. The highest SSC medians were recorded in the Fall but SSC was elevated in all seasons. High SSC levels in receiving waters may be caused by field ditching activities and insufficient sediment controls.

The objective of this work was to characterize the factors controlling spatial and temporal variability in surface peat (0–15 cm) and pore water chemistry of 18 regionally representative peatlands in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The pollution gradient is clearly evident as Cu and Ni concentrations in surface peat are elevated close to the main Copper Cliff smelter. Surface peat also differs greatly in acidity (pH) and organic matter content among sites, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in pore water are positively correlated with peat carbon content. In addition, sites having surface peat that is more decomposed also have pore water DOC that is more humified. Pore water chemistry varies seasonally; samples taken in late summer and fall were characterized by higher SO4, and lower pH and higher concentrations of base cations and metals such as Ni, Co, and Mn compared with those in late spring that had higher DOC, higher pH, and higher concentrations of metals such as Cu and Fe. Despite the large spatial and temporal variability in pore water chemistry, soil-solution partitioning (Kd) of some metals (Ni, Co, and Mn) can be explained by pH alone. Modeling soil-solution partitioning for these metals and Cu, Al, and Fe is significantly improved with the addition of SO4; dissolved organic matter quality and quantity and/or the δ18O signature of the pore water in regression models indicating several factors other than acidity has an influence on pore water chemistry.","2015-09-04","2025-01-08 20:47:01","2025-03-07 22:07:10","","326","","10","226","","Water, Air, Soil Pollut.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>- This paper examines the impact of metal pollution from Ni-Cu smelting on the biogeochemisttry of peatlands in Sudbury, ON. </p>","","","Canada; Ontario; biogeochemistry; peatland; mining; peat; mineral processing; pollution; air pollution; metal/metalloid; substrate; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results show a 20th-century age for the palsa formation and repeated periods of permafrost aggradation and collapse at the peat plateau site during the late Holocene. This timing of permafrost dynamics corroborates well with that inferred from previous studies on other permafrost peatlands in the same region. The developmental history of the palsa and peat plateau bogs is similar to that of adjacent permafrost-free fens, except for the specific frost heave and collapse features associated with permafrost dynamics. Permafrost aggradation and degradation is ascribed to regional climatic, local autogenic and other factors. Particularly the very recent palsa development can be assessed in terms of climatic changes as inferred from meteorological data and surface hydrological changes related to construction of the railroad.

Our goal was to identify environmental controls on peat decomposition, particularly its sensitivity to naturally occurring changes in temperature, oxygen exposure time, and vegetation. All three varied substantially during the last 7000years, providing a natural experiment for evaluating their effects on decomposition. The bottom 50cm of the core formed during the Holocene Climatic Optimum (7000-4000years B.P.), when mean annual air temperature was likely 1-2 degrees C warmer than present. A reconstruction of the water table level using testate amoebae indicated oxygen exposure time was highest in the subsequent upper portion of the core between 150 and 225cm depth (from 2560 to 4210years B.P.) and the plant community shifted from mostly Sphagnum to vascular plant dominance. Several independent biochemical indices indicated that decomposition was greatest in this interval. Hydrolysable amino acid yields, hydroxyproline yields, and acid:aldehyde ratios of syringyl lignin phenols were higher, while hydrolysable neutral sugar yields and carbon:nitrogen ratios were lower in this zone of both vascular plant vegetation and elevated oxygen exposure time. Thus, peat formed during the Holocene Climatic Optimum did not appear to be more extensively decomposed than peat formed during subsequent cooler periods. Comparison with a core from the West Siberian Lowland, Russia, indicates that oxygen exposure time and vegetation are both important controls on decomposition, while temperature appears to be of secondary importance. The low apparent sensitivity of decomposition to temperature is consistent with recent observations of a positive correlation between peat accumulation rates and mean annual temperature, suggesting that contemporary warming could enhance peatland carbon sequestration, although this could be offset by an increasing contribution of vascular plants to the vegetation.","2015-06","2025-01-08 20:47:01","2025-03-12 01:56:41","","729-743","","6","29","","Global Biogeochem.

Decomposition refers to the breakdown of fresh plant tissue, with the detritus becoming progressively finer, until eventually all vestiges of the original fibrous structure are lost and the peat has an amorphous, almost granular form. From a geotechnical perspective, the partly decomposed plant matter has a major influence on peat behavior, with the peat properties closely related to the average state of decomposition. The destruction of the plant tissue causes a reduction in the material's water holding capacity and weakens the absorption complex which results in the reduction of both its water content and liquid limit values. The reduction in the organic content and the destruction of the inherent fibrous structure also causes an increase in bulk density. An evaluation of the compressibility characteristics of peats at different states of decomposition has been performed from a review of previous research reported in literature. The Cα/Cc ratio of peat ranges between 0.035 and 0.1, with the lower value corresponding to amorphous peat. Hence, it is expected that the more decomposed the peat material, the lower its compressibility. This paper also presents a preliminary study on the potential for decomposition of peats maintained at a constant temperature of 30 C and under partially-saturated conditions over an extended period.","2012","2025-01-08 20:47:01","2025-03-07 18:21:18","","4329-4338","","","","","","","Geotechnical Special Publication","","","","American Society of Civil Engineers","","","","","","","","","SC: 0000034","<p>- This paper examines the effect of decomposition on the geotechnical properties of peats. </p>","","","peatland; linear disturbance; decomposition; peat; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; roads; compaction; geotechnical properties; infrastructure; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Linear features are pervasive across the landscape, and of particular importance, seismic lines established in the 1900s (legacy seismic lines) are slow to regenerate. Off-highway vehicles are widely used on these seismic lines and can hamper vegetative re-growth because of ongoing physical damage, compaction, and active clearing. Restoration of seismic lines within caribou range is therefore a priority for the recovery of threatened populations in Alberta, but a triage-type approach is necessary to prioritize restoration and ensure conservation resources are wisely spent. To target restoration efforts, our objective was to determine factors that best explained levels of off-highway vehicles use on seismic lines intersecting roads. We investigated the relative importance of local topography, vegetation attributes of seismic lines, and broad-scale human factors such as the density of infrastructures and the proximity to recreation campsites and towns to explain the observed levels of off-highway vehicles use. We found that off-highway vehicles use was mainly associated with local topography and vegetation attributes of seismic lines that facilitated ease-of-travel. Broad-scale landscape attributes associated with industrial, recreation access, or hunting activities did not explain levels of off-highway vehicles use. Management actions aimed at promoting natural regeneration and reduce ease-of-travel on legacy seismic lines within caribou ranges can be beneficial to caribou recovery in Alberta, Canada, and we therefore recommend restrictions of off-highway vehicles use on low vegetation, dry seismic lines in caribou ranges.","2016-11","2025-01-08 20:47:01","2025-03-12 01:49:52","","821-832","","5","58","","Environ.

At a broad scale, wolves showed evidence of habitat-driven functional responses by exhibiting greater selection for areas near low-vegetation height seismic lines in areas with low densities of anthropogenic features. We highlight the importance of considering landscape heterogeneity and habitat characteristics, and the functional response in habitat selection when investigating seasonal behaviour-based selection patterns. Our results support behaviour in line with search for primary prey during summer and fall, and ease-of-travel during spring, while patterns of selection during winter aligned best with ease-of-travel for the less-industrialized foothills landscape, and with search for primary prey in the more-industrialized boreal landscape.

It is becoming more common to install temporary structures, which can subsequently be removed. However, little is known regarding the temporary or permanent hydrologic and biogeochemical impacts of temporary structures.         In 2013, a temporary Access Road (at Pad 106) within the Firebag Fen in northeast Alberta was reclaimed to evaluate immediate and longer-term hydrologic and biogeochemical responses within the fen. Prior to its removal, the road hindered the natural water flow, and the restriction of runoff by the road led to vegetation mortality on the up-gradient (wet) side of the road. The long-term goal of the Suncor Firebag Road Removal Reclamation Project was to determine the capacity of the affected fen to naturally self-correct and self-regulate following road removal before intervention attempts. The specific objectives of this thesis are to: (1) compare peat physical characteristics and hydraulic conductivity in disturbed peat and undisturbed peat; and (2) determine the rate of change in water table and hydraulic gradients on both sides of the road immediately following road removal.         Coring locations and groundwater well sites were located along transects running perpendicular to the road and, once the road was removed, on the peat that was underneath the road. Cores were collected for the determination of peat physical characteristics. Groundwater wells were installed for the determination of water table position and hydraulic gradients. Meteorologic conditions were monitored with a on-site station at the Firebag Fen site and showed variability between monitoring stations, and across the road, but consistently over time.         Results indicate that the direction of flow was diagonal to the road. Heads decreased from the east (566.01 m.a.s.l mean) to the west (565.33 m.a.s.l mean) over 179 m and from Transect 1 (565.54 m.a.s.l mean) to Transect 4 (565.86 m.a.s.l mean) over 182 m. Median saturated hydraulic conductivity determined from laboratory measurments did not vary between the road and adjacent peatlands (10-3 – 10-2 m/s). Significant differences between the road and adjacent peatlands were not found for saturated hydraulic conductivity (p < 0.05). Porosity, bulk density, and specific yield varied significantly (p < 0.05) between peat on the east side of the road and the peat beneath the removed road. Porosity and bulk density also differed significantly between the east and west sides of the road (p < 0.05). Immediately following road removal, peat subsidence beneath the road was apparent. However, as the summer 2013 field season progressed, measured rates of peat subsidence began to slow 45 days post road removal, suggesting that the peat may have begun to rebound.","2015","2025-01-08 20:47:01","2025-03-12 01:48:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Watterloo","Waterloo","","","M.Sc.","","","","","SC: 0000007","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis examines the rebound from a temporary access road removal in fen in Alberta. &nbsp;Peat subsidence slows within 45 days of road removal.</p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; on-site restoration; substrate disturbance; subsidence; active restoration; fen; mitigation hierarchy; revegetation; hydrological alteration; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As wildfire is one of the prevalent stand-replacing natural disturbances in the Canadian boreal forest, it is an important driver of environmental change and stand development that may contribute to the mitigation of such linear industrial footprint. Here, we evaluate the short-term cumulative (also known as combined) effects of seismic lines and wildfire on biodiversity and site conditions. One year after the Horse River (Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada) fire event in the spring of 2016, we compared dissected and undisturbed forests in burned and unburned boreal peatlands, assessing changes in overall stand structure and the responses of a variety of organisms. Soil moisture was significantly higher on seismic lines than in the adjacent forest, suggesting why most of the study sites within the fire perimeter showed little evidence of burning at the line in relation to the adjacent forest. Low fire severity on seismic lines seemed an important driver of local species diversity for ants, beetles, spiders, and plants in disturbed peatlands, resulting in similar species composition on seismic lines both within and outside the burned area, but different assemblages in burned and unburned adjacent forests. Our results suggest that fire did not erase seismic lines; rather, wildfire might increase the influence of this footprint on the recovering adjacent forest. Longer-term monitoring will be necessary to understand how boreal treed peatlands respond to the cumulative effect of wildfire and linear disturbances.","2021-04","2025-01-08 20:47:02","2025-03-07 22:06:57","","e02281","","3","31","","Ecol.

An improved understanding of nutrient cycling and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange interactions in peatlands can assist in recommending best management practices to industry to minimize the ecohydrological disturbance footprint of road features. Peat nutrient (nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P) supply, net mineralization, groundwater concentrations, and peatland-atmosphere CO2 exchange rates were quantified within a poor fen bisected by a semi-permanent road located in the Athabasca Oil Sands region of Alberta, Canada, over one growing season. Results demonstrate that the road impeded groundwater movement across the site; however, water table and moisture differences were minimal, likely due to the unusually wet season. No clear impacts of the road on nutrient dynamics were observed, but subtle differences in productivity and respiration resulted in significantly lower net CO2 sequestration (net ecosystem exchange) on the down-flow side of the road. Differences in vegetation composition between sides of the road were apparent and likely indicate longer-term moisture differences at the site. Elevated rates of productivity and respiration coincided with a seasonal change in the relative supplies of N and P (increased N : P ratios), suggesting that the relative availability of N versus P may be important to CO2 fluxes in Western Boreal Plains peatlands.

Yet, the consequences of behavioral responses toward human disturbances on vital rates rarely have been investigated. Herein, we assessed the cumulative and instantaneous effects of human disturbances (roads, human settlements, mines and mining exploration) at different temporal scales on the mortality risk of 254 GPS- collared migratory caribou monitored in two herds, the Riviere-aux-Feuilles (RFH) and Riviere-George (RGH) herds, in northern Quebec and Labrador, Canada. We also assessed the relative importance of human disturbances on caribou mortality risk compared with non-anthropogenic factors, including habitat use by caribou, predation risk by gray wolves (Canis lupus), and local weather conditions. Human disturbances alone, exclusive of hunting, had a limited impact on mortality risk of caribou. Repeated exposure to disturbances did not have detectable effects on mortality risk during the early life period (1-7 years old), but more abundant precipitation (RFH) or the use of areas with a higher predation risk (RGH) did so. At the seasonal scale, non-anthropogenic factors, particularly the use of highly selected habitat by caribou and air temperature, had a greater effect than anthropogenic factors on the mortality risk in the RFH. Caribou of the RFH using more frequently higlhy selected habitats decreased their chance of mortality during winter, whereas individuals using warmer areas during summer faced a higher risk of mortality. At the daily scale, we observed that anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic factors generally had either no effect on the daily risk of mortality, or their effects were undistinguishable from the effect of latitude, with which they were highly correlated. The only exception was for the RFH in winter, for which the daily risk of mortality increased 10 folds for each 10-km increment closer to industrial disturbances. Although the impacts of human disturbances on caribou survival were limited to specific regions and areas, we nevertheless detected a negative effect on survival on the RFH, even at the currently low level of human development. Our study highlights the importance of assessing effects of human disturbances at various spatiotemporal scales, and of considering the relative influence of other non-anthropogenic factors to fully understand drives of wildlife populations.","2020-06","2025-01-08 20:47:02","2025-03-12 01:49:50","","","","","8","","Front.

Treatment wetlands are established on intact or formerly drained peatlands after restoration of the site hydrology by ditch blocking or other methods. However, drainage changes the physical properties of peat, so the hydraulic and hydrological conditions in peatlands may change. Consequently, treatment wetlands constructed on drained areas may have short residence times, resulting in poor purification results. This study determined the hydrological and hydraulic characteristics of treatment wetlands constructed on drained peatlands by studying peat hydraulic conductivity and water distribution in 20 different wetlands in Finland. Four wetlands were studied in more detail using tracer tests, water balance and continuous groundwater measurements. More than 50% of the drained treatment wetlands studied had a lower active flow depth layer (only 10 or 20 cm) with higher hydraulic conductivity (K) than normally found in pristine peatlands. At 25% of the sites, K was high at all depths investigated (down to 60-70 cm). At several sites, the water was unequally distributed across the wetland surface, indicating that only part of the wetland was being used for purification. The residence time, as determined by tracer tests, varied significantly between sites. These results indicate that past drainage still influences the hydraulics of treatment wetlands.

According to national strategies for extracting peat in Finland, new peat extraction areas should be established on previously drained peatlands. On such areas it is difficult to find the natural, intact peatland required for treatment wetlands or so-called overland flow areas, which are considered the best available technology for runoff water purification. Therefore treatment wetlands must be constructed on drained peatland. It is known that drainage causes physical, biogeochemical and hydraulic changes in the peat layer, as well as changes in vegetation. It is probable that these changes affect the purification efficiency of wetland treatment systems in many ways. This study evaluated the function and characteristics of drained peatland areas for purification of peat extraction runoff water. Study sites were established on 11 drained wetlands and their purification efficiency was evaluated. Detailed measurements of peat physical properties and hydraulic conductivity, as well as studies on vegetation, were also made in the study areas. The results showed that wetlands constructed on drained peatland areas can purify peat extraction runoff. However, leaching of phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) was observed in some areas. Leaching is influenced e.g. by pH and the soil P pool. The chemical oxygen demand was also observed to increase in runoff water from the wetland. The results indicated that low (Fe+aluminium (Al)+manganese (Mn))/P ratio (1200mg/kg) in the surface peat characterized those areas where P leaching was observed. The presence of a dense tree stand in a drained peatland area also seemed to indicate release of nutrients from the area after its rewetting and use as a treatment wetland. Thus, potential nutrient release from a drained peatland area intended for use as a treatment wetland can be assessed by studying the characteristics of the peatland area, especially the peat mineral content, and the vegetation, especially tree stand density in the area. Using the findings obtained, a conceptual decision tree was drawn up in order to help to establish and design wetlands in previously drained peatland areas.","2014","2025-01-08 20:47:02","2025-02-25 14:24:18","","33-43","","","228-229","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines whether post-extraction peatlands can act as treatment wetlands for the remediation of runoff from peat extraction surfaces.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; hydrology; peatland; peat; nutrients; drawdown; pollution; impact minimization; treatment wetland; mitigation hierarchy; metal/metalloid; surface water/runoff; substrate; remediation; fertility change/contamination; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following large-scale restoration of a cut-over peatland, vegetation was surveyed biannually over 8 years. We evaluated whether the establishing plant communities fell within the range of natural variation. We used both general diversity curves and PRC applied on plant species grouped by preferred habitat to compare restored sites and unrestored sites to a reference ecosystem. After 8 years, diversity and richness differed between the sites, with Forest and Ruderal species more prominent in unrestored sites, and Peatland, Forest, and Wetland species dominant in restored sites. The PRC revealed that the restored site became rapidly dominated by typical peatland plants, the main drivers of temporal changes being <i>Sphagnum rubellum</i>, <i>Pohlia nutans</i>, and <i>Mylia anomala</i>. Some differences remained between the restored and the undisturbed species pools: the former had more herbaceous species associated with wetlands such as <i>Calamagrostis canadensis</i> and <i>Typha latifolia</i> and the latter had more forested species like <i>Kalmia angustifolia</i> throughout the study. PRC revealed to be an efficient tool identifying species driving changes at the community level after restoration. In our case study, examining PRC scores after classifying species according to their preferred habitat allowed to illustrate objectively how restoration promotes target species (associated to peatlands) and how lack of intervention benefits ruderal species.","2013","2025-01-08 20:47:02","2025-03-07 22:07:56","","363-371","","3","21","","Restor.

The two dominant methods for peat extraction, hand block-cutting and vacuum-mining, have created distinctly different abandoned surfaces, leading to different recolonization patterns. Both types of exploitation can be found throughout eastern Canada where we conducted a vast survey of 26 abandoned mined peatlands in the provinces of Québec and New Brunswick. The aim of this study is to describe the revegetation patterns and to assess the impact of local and regional variables as well as the time since abandonment on Sphagnum recolonization. We inventoried the vegetation structure in all trenches (2571) and baulks (2595) of abandoned block-cut areas as well as in all vacuum fields (395) of the mechanically mined areas. We also conducted detailed species relevés in 242 of these peat fields. In comparison to vacuum-mined peatlands, block-cut peatlands regenerated remarkably well. Approximately 80% of all baulks and trenches in block-cut peatlands had 50% or higher cover of ericaceous shrubs compared with only 16% found on vacuum fields. Herb cover in the three types of abandoned fields was similar to that in natural peatlands. However, Sphagnum percent cover was below 2% in baulks and vacuum fields and was 30% on average in the trenches, which is clearly below cover estimates in natural peatlands. Sphagnum cover and richness were both higher in trenches with thin residual peat deposit, and Sphagnum richness increased with latitude.

A mineral road placed within a peatland changes the nature of the substrate and influences the water table level and the physicochemical characteristics of the water and peat. These changes can modify the composition of the plant communities. We examined whether burying the mineral material within the bog (Peat Inversion Technique [PIT]) is an effective method to restore the peatland conditions. The method should meet restorations goals by (1) confining the nutrients introduced with the mineral material, (2) conserving a peaty surface elevation similar to the adjacent areas, and (3) by re-establishing typical peatland vegetation. At both one and three years’ post-restoration, the results of the physicochemical analyses of the water sampled at various depths and distances of the buried road presented similar nutrient concentrations to the means observed in the reference ecosystems. The small soil elevation differences observed in the restored areas between readings show that the compaction and leveling used in the PIT are appropriate to fulfill the pursued objectives. The return of peatland plant communities varied depending on the site, mainly due to local factors. Ultimately, the results of this project show that the PIT complies with restoration objectives. Furthermore, it is cost effective in comparison with another restoration technique, the complete removal of the mineral material.","2019","2025-01-08 20:47:03","2025-03-07 18:20:55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Denver, Colorado,","","","","","","","","SC: 0000001","<p>- This paper presents a method to restore road crossings on peatlands by inverting the road under the peat.</p>","","","Canada; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; on-site restoration; roads; active restoration; mitigation hierarchy; burial; revegetation; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposal has garnered considerable interest, both positive and negative, across sectors. On one hand, there is recognition that offsetting represents an opportunity to achieve important conservation gains by integrating the true environmental and social costs of wetland loss into development decisions. On the other, there is understandable concern that if the policy is poorly conceived, implemented or enforced, offsetting will undermine existing wetland protections and open the door to further loss. As the Ontario government moves forward with its wetland offsetting policy, great care and attention are warranted. If done effectively, wetland offsetting could be a positive force for conservation, helping to reverse the ongoing trend of wetland loss in the province. If done poorly, however, it will do more harm than good. Navigating the Swamp: Lessons on Wetland Offsetting for Ontario explores both the promise and the pitfalls of wetland offsetting, with the aim of informing policy development in Ontario. The report surveys relevant laws and policies in the United States and Canada, as well as those in Alberta, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. It also reviews policy outcomes and lessons learned, particularly from those jurisdictions where wetland offsetting policy has been in place and implemented for many years. The laws and policies reviewed illustrate a range of approaches to wetland offsetting at various stages of development and implementation. Nowhere is there a resounding success story, where offsetting has been demonstrated to achieve its full potential. Nevertheless, there are positive signs, and many governments are making a concerted effort to learn from the past and develop better ways forward. This report examines the major challenges, highlights best practices and promising approaches, and provides recommendations for the Government of Ontario, based on the evidence presented.","2017","2025-01-08 20:47:03","2025-03-07 22:08:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontario Nature","","","","","","","","","","<p>- This paper reviews the emergent policies of wetland offsetting in Canada and the United States and makes recommendations on the best approaches for wetland offsetting in Ontario.</p>","","","Ontario; provincial policy/statute; offsetting; policy discussion paper; wetland policy; mitigation hierarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measured water table level, peat water content and temperature, and rates of decomposition of Sphagnum peat, cellulose and wood sticks in a black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP.) peatland of eastern Québec, on a control site and a drained site. In general, the water table was lowered within 15 m of the ditches, resulting in a marked difference between spacings of 20-30 m and 40-50-60 m. In the middle of the 40-m spacing, the frequencies of lowering below the root zone (20 cm) and the 30-cm depth were respectively increased by 33% and 40%. Peat water content at 10-cm depth decreased by 20% to 29% following drainage and the effect appeared related to ditch closeness. At 20- and 30-cm depths, decreases of the same order were observed only at 5 m from the ditch. At distances of 10 m and more, the average water content remained within 10% of saturation at 20 cm and within 5% at 30 cm. After drainage, the seasonal maximum temperature at the 10-cm depth increased by 3.5°C at 5 m from the ditch and by 1.5°C at greater distances, compared to the control where the mean seasonal maximum was 13.5°C. At all distances, the autumnal cooling of the substrate was accelerated and winter temperature was 1 to 2°C less than the control site. Temperature at 30-cm depth was not modified by drainage. Rates of decomposition were accelerated, mainly at the 30-cm depth and within the first 10 m from the ditch. At 10-cm depth, decomposition was weakly related to drainage and it is possible that relatively low water contents countered the effect of temperature increase.","1997-01-01","2025-01-08 20:47:03","2025-03-07 18:21:18","","543-554","","4","4","","Ecoscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","1.3","4","SC: 0000074","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of dropping the water table on peat decomposition and soil temperature in treed peatlands in Québec.

Vegetation and peat, in turn influence the hydrology through their effect on surface flow (Quinton and Hayashi 2005), groundwater (Siegel and Glaser 1987) and evapotranspiration (Lafleur et al. 2005). The functional links between plants, peat and water constitute a strongly coupled eco-hydrological feedback system.There are many approaches to peatland classification (Moore 1984), reflecting in part the closely coupled plant–soil–water system. Because of the fundamental link between peat formation and hydrological conditions, it may be argued that hydrological status is a primary criterion in the classification of peatlands. The most basic distinction between two main mire types, bogs and fens, is based on water source. Fens receive minerogenous (rich in dissolved minerals) surface- and groundwater inputs in addition to precipitation. Bogs are peatlands that are entirely ombrogenous (fed only by precipitation) and often develop over fens (Kuhry et al. 1993), as the accumulating peat raises the elevation of the surface and the water table, isolating them from minerogenous water inputs. Further subdivisions of fen and bog are commonly identified through their hydrogeomorphic setting (Brinson 1993; Charman 2002), which is arguably a proxy for water source and water-table regime. In North America, minerogeneous systems are commonly further divided into swamps and fens (NWWG 1997). This distinction is drawn based on vegetation cover (swamps are forested while fens support graminoid and brown moss species), but, in fact, because of the strong plant–water coupling this reflects varying hydrological status with swamps characterised by a strongly variable water table (that allows tree growth), while fen systems have stable high water tables. In maritime climates, such as that of the British Isles and in Newfoundland, very high rainfall supports the development of ‘blanket’ bogs particularly in upland areas. Blanket bogs are laterally extensive, blanketing the pre-existing topography. Consequently, they typically include both true bog and areas where upslope drainage is a significant component of the water budget (although that drainage in intact mires may be nutrient-poor waters sourced from upslope bogs).","2016","2025-01-08 20:47:03","2025-03-07 18:20:42","","77-94","","","","","","","Ecological Reviews","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","","","","","","Cambridge Core","","SC: 0000039","<p>- This chapter presents a review of the hydrology of peatlands in the context of their restoration. </p>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; peat; substrate disturbance; rewetting; active restoration; mitigation hierarchy; substrate; hydrological management; revegetation; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","Bonn, Aletta; Allott, Tim; Evans, Martin; Joosten, Hans; Stoneman, Rob","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Straw mulch caused rainfall interception approaching 2 mm per event. Although interception represented 44% of the total rainfall over the measurement period, water that evaporated from the mulch used energy that would otherwise have been used to evaporate soil water. Thus, the net effect of interception by mulch was negligible. The soil heat flux below the mulch was only 13% of the bare soil value and was decoupled from the daily net radiation. Net radiation over the bare soil was 15% greater than over the mulch. However, because of the greater heat flux into the bare peat, the energy available for sensible and latent heat fluxes was similar between the mulch covered and bare peat. Average evaporation from mulch and bare soil was estimated to be 2.6 and 3.1 mm d−1, respectively. Soil water tension 1 cm below the surface remained above −100 cm (mb) all season (100% of the time) when a mulch was used, compared to only 30% of the time in the bare soil. Correspondingly, the water table was sustained above the 40 cm depth, 60% of time in the mulch covered site, compared to only 40% of the time in the bare peat site. Negative relief elements of the microtopography were wetter and cooler than positive relief elements. However, when under a mulch, the negative relief elements provided no additional benefit, in terms of temperature or soil moisture amelioration. The control site with a mulch cover was equivalent or better than negative relief elements with a mulch cover. Taking into account the poorer performance of positive relief elements, even when mulch covered, the creation of surface microtopography reduced the overall moisture content of the site. Sphagnum established and spread only when the diaspores were protected with a straw mulch. All microtopography types tested had no effect on the establishment of Sphagnum mosses when the microtopography treatments, including positive and negative relief elements, were treated as a whole, although being in a depression helped Sphagnum establishment.","1998-07-01","2025-01-08 20:47:03","2025-03-07 22:07:53","","293-312","","4","10","","Ecol.

In this study, drainage ditches blocked after harvesting restored the water balance to a condition similar to a nearby natural bog. Evaporation averaged 2.9 and 2.7?mm day?1 on the cutover and natural bog, respectively. Evaporation consumed most of the rainfall input (86 and 80%, respectively), whereas runoff was minor at both sites (6 and 4%, respectively). However, the water table position was markedly different at these sites. Median water table depth was 0.05 m below the surface in the natural bog, compared with 0.44 m in the cutover bog (ditches blocked). Changes to the peak soil matrix owing to drainage and cutting reduced the specific yield (Sy) of the peat to 0.04-0.06 from 0.35-0.55, causing exaggerated water table changes in the cutover site. Nevertheless, volumetric soil moisture in the cutover site (0.67 ± 0.08) had low variability, and was maintained above moisture contents found in Sphagnum hummocks in the natural bog (0.48 ±0.10), although less than on Sphagnum lawn (0.84±0.11). Poor Sphagnum regeneration on cutover surfaces can therefore be attributed to its inability to extract water from the underlying peat, which retains water at matric suction greater than the non-vascular <i>Sphagnum </i>can generate. The corrupted iron pan under main ditches has permitted partial recharge of the underlying aquifer, reducing local hydraulic gradients, thereby decreasing vertical seepage loss.","1996-01-01","2025-01-08 20:47:03","2025-03-07 18:20:55","","1263-1272","","10","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.2","3","SC: 0000220","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the hydrology and microclimate of a partially restored peatland following peat extraction.

Drainage and removal of the acrotelm can result in surface subsidence of up to 3.7 cm y-1 m-1 of peat shortly after drainage (compression), and long-term rates up to 0.3 cm y-1 m-1 (compression and oxidation). This can decrease the hydraulic conductivity by over 75%, and decrease the water retention capacity and specific yield. In old abandoned systems, drainage ditches may continue to facilitate a significant seasonal water loss. Colonization of abandoned sites by trees may increase the evapotranspirative losses by as much as 25%, and interception losses can be as high as 32% of rainfall. Without natural or planned occlusion of ditches, some peatlands become drier over time. Blocking ditches may largely restore water balance components, although the hydrological regime requires years to stabilise sufficiently for<i> Sphagnum</i> recolonization, especially where residual peat is well decomposed, having inadequate water storage capacity. Consequently, winter precipitation (Europe) and spring snowmelt (North America) are critical recharge periods. Over the long term, consolidation of the peat due to drainage and methane production (where drainage systems are blocked and soils reflooded) decreases hydraulic conductivity, thereby reducing lateral seepage losses. This may actually assist in <i>Sphagnum</i> recolonization. A regenerated cover of <i>Sphagnum </i>increases soil wetness and reduces water tension (increases pore-water pressure) in the substrate, thus ameliorating its own environment. However, natural recolonization and recovery of many hydrological and ecological processes may not occur, or may require many decades. Water management and selective plant reintroduction can accelerate this. Water management options such as blocking ditches, constructing bunds, reconfiguring the surface and managing microclimate have met with varying degrees of success. No standard management prescription can be made because each site presents unique challenges.","2003-02","2025-01-08 20:47:03","2025-03-07 18:20:55","","65-83","","1-2","11","","Wetlands Ecol.

Industry and environmental monitoring agencies have questioned the ability to reclaim fen peatlands in the post-mine landscape. This study proposes a conceptual model to replace fen systems with fen peat materials supported by groundwater inflow from a constructed watershed. A numerical model is used to determine the optimum system geometry, including the ratio of upland to fen area, thickness and slope of sand materials, and thickness of peat and of the liner that would result in flows that sustain peat wetness to a critical threshold soil water pressure of -100 cm of water at a peat depth of 10 cm. We also test the sensitivity of the system to variations in the value and spatial configuration of the hydraulic conductivity (K) of locally available materials. The optimal conditions were achieved using an upland area at least twice that of the fen, underlain by a sloping (3%) layer of fine-grained material with hydraulic conductivity (K) of 10-10 m/s, that maintains lateral groundwater flow in a sand layer with K of 10-4 to 10-5 m/s. Using daily climate inputs that included 1998, the driest summer on record, the model suggests that adequate wetness can be sustained in the fen for the growing season, and that the extent of water table recession was similar to undisturbed systems during that period. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","2010","2025-01-08 20:47:03","2025-03-13 15:26:22","","109-123","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SC: 0000174","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents a conceptual model of the hydrology of a fen constructed for mine reclamation in the Alberta oil sands region. </p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; peat; groundwater; soil moisture; drawdown; mine reclamation; ecosystem conversion; fen; mitigation hierarchy; substrate; mine planning; hydrological alteration; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lowering of the water table caused drainage above the water table, but the specific yield (S-y) of the peat was relatively small (0.48), and did not adequately describe the water storage change. Lowering of the water table also caused surface subsidence, which was shown to be partly due to shrinkage above the water table (<3.6 cm), and partly due to compression of the saturated peat (about 6 cm). Measured total surface subsidence ranged from 6.5 to 10 cm. The change in pear volume occurred over the entire depth of the peat deposit (b), and so the storativity due to peat compression (bS(s)), estimated to be 0.13, was more important than specific yield in determining water storage changes. Total storativity (S-tot) was best estimated as the sum S-y + bS(s). Changes in peat volume in the 0-3 cm layer were evident in the temporally variable bulk density (83-101 kg m(-3)). Its relationship with Volumetric moisture content was highly hysteretic, reflecting the complexity of the process in the unsaturated zone. However, there was a linear relationship with water tension, suggesting a more direct causal relationship. Changes in pest volume were also recorded below the water table, as the volumetric water content of the saturated peat decreased by 3.5% over the season. Since this applied to a relatively thick layer of peat, its total effect was greater than shrinkage in the zone above the water table. It was concluded that most peatland water balances should make account of storage changes associated with peat Volume changes, and that peat volume changes may increase the water limitations to plants when the water table drops below the surface.

Distinct hydrologic conditions were observed where Sphagnum has successfully recolonized, providing a basis for establishing thresholds that can be targeted by peatland restoration managers. Sites where Sphagnum mosses recolonized were characterized by high water table (mean−24.9±14.3 cm), soil moisture (ϕ) > 50%, and soil-water pressure (Ψ)≥ 100 mb. These hydrologic indicators were spatially organized according to the morphology of block- cut trenches, which typically include raised baulks, shallow ditches, and the convex skag (unused turf) deposits along the central axis of the trench. Topographically low areas like the shallow ditches (D) and lower parts of the skag (LS) adjacent to the ditches maintained ϕ and Ψ > 50% and − 100 mb, respectively, for 100% of the summer period. About 83% of all Sphagnum recolonization that occurred in the study trench did so in these areas. In more raised areas like the mid- and center portion of the skag, ϕ and Ψ eventually fell below these thresholds, and these areas generally did not support Sphagnum, except in a few localized microtopographic depressions in the lower (downslope) end of the trench. While this lower end of the trench had all the Sphagnum species that were present in the trench, even there it was only 38% of the total area.

Under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, northern peatlands are projected to remain a net sink of CO2 and climate neutral for the next three centuries. A shift to a net CO2 source and a substantial increase in CH4 emissions are projected under RCP8.5, which could exacerbate global warming by 0.21°C (range, 0.09–0.49°C) by the year 2300.

Low volume spray spills that uniformly covered the ground caused initial damage to vegetation, but after 20 years recovery of the understory vegetation was almost complete, with dramatic recovery and expansion of fruticose lichens. High-volume point spills created small areas of surface oil saturation with dead vegetation and little sign of recovery but spread out mostly belowground with little or no apparent effect on the shallowly rooted vegetation above even after 15-20 years. Because winter point spills created a much greater area of surface oil, their effects were more damaging. After 15 years on the saturated surface oiled areas, only <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> tussocks survive and grow. At both sites with surface oil, black spruce mortality was high, with no evidence of long-term recovery and with continuing chronic effects after 15 years. However, from a long-term perspective the black spruce taiga ecosystem appears to be able to recover from low volume spray spills and to retain large amounts of crude-oil from high-volume point spills belowground with minimal damage to the vegetation. Because of the permafrost, removal of crude oil from this ecosystem by soil excavation is undesirable. In situ acceleration of oil breakdown using fertilizers and bacteria is a possible option; seeding or planting of E. vaginatum on surface-oiled areas may also provide some cover and belowground biomass.","1994-08","2025-01-08 20:47:04","2025-03-07 18:19:48","","1171-1177","","8","72","","Can.

This intensification of the rainfall regime is expected to alter near-surface water availability, which will affect plant performance and carbon uptake. This could be especially important in peatland systems, where large stores of carbon are tightly coupled to water surpluses limiting decomposition. Here, we examined the role of precipitation frequency on vegetation growth and carbon dioxide (CO(2) ) balances for communities dominated by a Sphagnum moss, a sedge, and an ericaceous shrub in a cool temperate poor fen. Field plots and laboratory monoliths received one of three rainfall frequency treatments, ranging from one event every three days to one event every 14 days, while total rain delivered in a two-week cycle and the entire season to each treatment remained the same. Separating incident rain into fewer but larger events increased vascular cover in all peatland communities: vascular plant cover increased 6× in the moss-dominated plots, nearly doubled in the sedge plots, and tripled in the shrub plots in Low-Frequency relative to High-Frequency treatments. Gross ecosystem productivity was lowest in moss communities receiving low-frequency rain, but higher in sedge and shrub communities under the same conditions. Net ecosystem exchange followed this pattern: fewer events with longer dry periods increased CO(2) flux to the atmosphere from the moss while vascular plant-dominated communities became more of a sink for CO(2) . Results of this study suggest that changes to rainfall frequency already occurring and predicted to continue will lead to increased vascular plant cover in peatlands and will impact their carbon-sink function.","2018-05","2025-01-08 20:47:04","2025-10-02 14:25:18","","2051-2065","","5","24","","Global Change Biol.","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","11.6","1","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the impact of precipitation frequency on the vegetation and carbon cycle dynamics of a poor fen using peat monoliths and a field study.

While the benefits and advantages of various restoration management practices have been identified, there has been less attention paid to the carbon exchange from unrestored peatlands at the ecosystem level. This study analyzed the carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from a post-extraction, unrestored peatland in Eastern Québec at both the plant community level, using chamber methods, and at the ecosystem level, using eddy covariance techniques for two successive years. Methane flux at the plant community level was also measured. The site is an overall source of CO2, releasing a cumulative annual total of 173 and 259 g C m−2 for 2014 and 2015, respectively and a small source of methane, releasing an average annual cumulative total of 1 g C m−2.

In addition to within-site spatial heterogeneity, there is evident between-site heterogeneity, but there is a lack of studies assessing whether different combinations of remotely sensed features and mapping approaches are needed in different types of landscapes. We evaluated the value of different mapping methods and remote sensing datasets and analyzed the kinds of differences present in vegetation patterns and their mappability between three northern boreal peatland landscapes in northern Finland. We utilized field-inventoried vegetation plots together with spectral, textural, topography and vegetation height remote sensing data from 0.02- to 3-m pixel size. Remote sensing data included true-color unmanned aerial vehicle images, aerial images with four spectral bands, aerial lidar data and multiple PlanetScope satellite images. We used random forest regressions for tracking plant functional type (PFT) coverage, non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination axes and fuzzy k-medoid plant community clusters. PFT regressions had variable performance for different study sites (R2 −0.03 to 0.69). Spatial patterns of some spectrally or structurally distinctive PFTs could be predicted relatively well. The first ordination axis represented wetness gradient and was well predicted using remotely sensed data (R2 0.64 to 0.82), but the other three axes had a less straightforward explanation and lower mapping performance (R2 −0.09 to 0.53). Plant community clusters were predicted most accurately in the sites with clear string-flark topography but less accurately in the flatter site (R2 0.16–0.82). The most important remote sensing features differed between dependent variables and study sites: different topographic, spectral and textural features; and coarse-scale and fine-scale datasets were the most important in different tasks.

Can plant communities be delineated with species data generalized into plant functional types? What are the benefits and drawbacks of the two selected remote-sensing approaches in mapping vegetation patterns, namely: (a) regression models of floristically defined fuzzy plant community clusters and (b) classification of predefined habitat types that combine vegetation and land cover information? Location Treeless 0.4 km2 mesotrophic string–flark fen in Kaamanen, northern Finland. Methods We delineated plant community clusters with fuzzy c-means clustering based on two different inventories of plant species and functional type distribution. We used multiple optical remote-sensing data sets, digital elevation models and vegetation height models derived from drone, aerial and satellite platforms from ultra-high to very high spatial resolution (0.05–3 m) in an object-based approach. We mapped spatial patterns for fuzzy and crisp plant community clusters using boosted regression trees, and fuzzy and crisp habitat types using supervised random forest classification. Results Clusters delineated with species-specific data or plant functional type data produced comparable results. However, species-specific data for graminoids and mosses improved the accuracy of clustering in the case of flarks and string margins. Mapping accuracy was higher for habitat types (overall accuracy 0.72) than for fuzzy plant community clusters (R2 values between 0.27 and 0.67). Conclusions For ecologically meaningful mapping of a patterned fen vegetation, plant functional types provide enough information. However, if the aim is to capture floristic variation in vegetation as realistically as possible, species-specific data should be used. Maps of plant community clusters and habitat types complement each other. While fuzzy plant communities appear to be floristically most accurate, crisp habitat types are easiest to interpret and apply to different landscape and biogeochemical cycle analyses and modeling.","2019","2025-01-08 20:47:05","2025-03-12 01:41:36","","1016-1026","","5","30","","J.

Power lines will potentially affect an additional 106 ha of wetlands, largely swamps in the Coast Mountains. Wetland functions that will be affected by the Project include hydrology, water quality, ecology and habitat. Following review of the Section 52 Application for the Project, Environment Canada (EC) requested that Northern Gateway provide a detailed assessment of wetland functions likely to be adversely affected and to provide more details on wetland compensation and monitoring plans. Following receipt of Environment Canada’s written evidence submission in December 2011, this assessment was updated and replaces the earlier draft dated November 2011. The assessment of the potential effects of the pipelines and ancillary facilities was based on a pipeline right-of-way (RoW) width of 50 m and a power line RoW width of 40 m which make up the Project Development Area (PDA). The 1 km wide pipeline corridor described in the Application is intended only to aid in the planning of the pipelines and the completion of the environmental assessment. The centreline shown within the 1 km corridor is for illustrative purposes only. The final locations of the pipelines could occur anywhere within the 1 km corridor. Following approval of the Project, the exact location of the pipelines will be finalized within the 1 km wide corridor during detailed engineering. The final pipeline route will be selected based upon the route selection criteria described in the Application (Volume 3, Section 2). The phases associated with Project activities used in the assessment include the following:  baseline existing conditions prior to development;  construction - includes RoW and infrastructure clearing, pipe installation, cleanup and reclamation;  operations - includes normal activities with stable surface conditions and reclaimed vegetation cover; and  decommissioning - includes removal of above ground structures, recontouring and reclamation. Environmental protection measures are described in detail in the Construction Environmental Protection and Management Plan in the Application Volume 7A. These include measures to protect wildlife, fisheries, hydrology, water quality and vegetation along with emergency response approaches and capabilities. The residual effect of the Project on wetlands is assessed as adverse, low to moderate magnitude, local extent, long-term, reversible and not significant. A plan to monitor the effects of the Project on wetlands will be developed prior to commencement of construction. This plan will be prepared in consultation with federal and provincial regulatory agencies, landowners, participating First Nations and other stakeholders. The plan will include goals, site selection, monitoring parameters, standards, schedule and adaptive management. A wetland compensation plan will be developed prior to construction in consultation with federal and provincial regulatory agencies, landowners, participating First Nations and other stakeholders.

In Ireland, approximately 84% of raised bogs (a priority habitat listed in Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive) have been affected by peat extraction. While restoration implies the return of ecosystem services that were characteristic of the pre-disturbed ecosystem, achieving this goal is often a challenge in degraded peatlands as post-drainage conditions vary considerably between sites. Here, we present multi-year greenhouse gas (GHG) and vegetation dynamics data from two former raised bogs in Ireland that were drained and either industrially extracted (milled) or cut on the margins for domestic use and subsequently rewetted (with no further management). When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the rewetted nutrient poor domestic cutover peatland was a net sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) (-49 +/- 66 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and a source of methane (CH4) (19.7 +/- 5 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), while the nutrient rich industrial cutaway was a net source of CO2 (0.66 +/- 168 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and CH4 (5.0 +/- 2.2 g Cm-2 yr(-1)). The rewetted domestic cutover site exhibited the expected range of micro-habitats and species composition found in natural (non-degraded) counterparts. In contrast, despite successful rewetting, the industrially extracted peatland did not exhibit typical raised bog flora. This study demonstrated that environmental and management variables can influence species composition and, therefore, the regeneration of species typical of natural sites, and has highlighted the climate benefits from rewetting degraded peatlands in terms of reduced GHG emissions. However, rewetting of degraded peatlands is a major challenge and in some cases reintroduction of bryophytes typical of natural raised bogs may be more difficult than the achievement of proper GHG emission savings.","2019-02","2025-01-08 20:47:05","2025-09-08 13:28:40","","547-560","","","127","","Ecol.

Temporal dynamics of the daily goodness of fits (R2) between Q and GDA were then examined to identify the most relevant conceptual model of runoff generation in this landscape. We observed high R2 values during low flow conditions (mean R2?=?0.93 for 2009 and 2010). During wetter periods and in particular during large runoff events, the relationship degraded rapidly and consistently, suggesting differences in quickflow response among the gauged catchments. At low flows, the six catchments generated equivalent amounts of runoff (mm), leading to a strong QGDA relationship. During high flows, total growing season runoff increased systematically with GDA between 8 and 50?km2 and then decreased with further increases in GDA. These differences were responsible for the observed breakdown in the daily QGDA relationships and also resulted in significant differences in total runoff among the six catchments during the wetter year. Quantitative landscape analysis using a 5-m resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation model revealed that near-stream zone characteristics vary systematically with scale in a manner that is consistent with the observed patterns of quickflow runoff response. In this northern peatland complex, fast-responding flowpaths in the spatially discrete near-stream zones may be the key determinant of catchment runoff efficiency at the small to medium (similar to 10 to similar to 200?km2) headwater catchment scales analysed here. Moreover, the relatively organized drainage patterns observed in this study are consistent with our understanding of ecohydrological feedbacks driving geomorphic evolution of northern peatlands.

Peatland restoration is recent and has seen significant advances in the 1990s. A new approach addressing the North American context has been developed and is presentedin this paper. The short-term goal of this approach is to establish a plant cover composed of peat bog species and to restore a water regime characteristic of peatland ecosystems. The long-term objective is to return the cutover areas to functional peat accumulating ecosystems. The approach developed for peatland restoration in North America involves the following steps: 1)field preparation, 2) diaspore collection, 3) diaspore introduction, 4) diaspore protection, and 5) fertilization. Field preparation aims at providing suitable hydrological conditions for diaspores through creation of microtopography and water retention basins, re-shaping cutover fields and blocking ditches. It is site specific because it depends largely onlocal conditions. The second step is the collection of the top 10 centimetres of the living vegetation in a natural bog as a source of diaspores. It is recommended to use a ratio of surface collected to surface restored between 1: 10 and 1: 15 in order to minimize the impact on natural bogs and to insure rapid plant establishment in less than four years. Diaspores are then spread as a thin layer on the bare peat surfaces to be restored. It has been demonstrated that too scant or too thick a layer decreases plant establishment success. Diaspores are then covered by a straw mulch applied at a rate of 3 000 kg ha-1 which provides improved water availabilityand temperature conditions. Finally, phosphorus fertilization favours more rapid substrate colonization by vascular plants, which have been shown to help stabilize the bare peat surface and act as nurse plants to the Sphagnum mosses.","2003-02-01","2025-01-08 20:47:05","2025-03-07 18:20:42","","3-20","","1","11","","Wetlands Ecol.

In this study, we hypothesised that highly decomposed peat offers a suitable substrate for mitigating AMD pollution of water bodies and that hydraulic load affects the removal efficiency of iron and sulphate. A lysimeter experiment was conducted mimicking peatland rewetting to quantify iron and sulphate removal and pH changes at different loading rates. The low initial pH of 4 rose to 6 and electrical conductivity declined by up to 47%. The initially high concentrations of iron (>250 mg/L) and sulphate (>770 mg/L) declined by, on average, 87 and 78%, respectively. The removal efficiency of sulphate was negatively correlated with either the hydraulic or the sulphate load, respectively, i. e. the lower the hydraulic load, the higher the removal efficiency of sulphate. However, the removal of iron was not explained by the load. The results imply that desulphurication and thus subsequent precipitation of iron sulphides was the main removal process and that peatland rewetting is an effective measure to mitigate AMD pollution of freshwater systems. For the heavily AMD-polluted studied section of the River Spree, we estimated by combining experimental with field data that a sulphate load reduction of the river by about 20% (36,827 tons/yr) will occur if all peatlands in the sub-catchment (6067 ha; 6.7% of the total area) are rewetted. Future investigations must show if the pollutant removal is declining over time in decomposed peat layers due to acidification and/or lack of bioavailable carbon and how the rewetting of peatland with AMD will affect the restoration of their ecosystem functioning in the long term.","2022","2025-01-08 20:47:06","2025-03-12 01:55:18","","","","","311","","J.

This study use a new method based on analysis of stabile oxygen and hydrogen isotope distributions in surface water in order to find water flow pathways in a treatment system established on a natural peatland in Ruka, Finland. The 18O/16O distributions of surface water samples were analysed in three field campaigns (2002, 2004, and 2005) and 2H/1H distribution in one field campaign (2002). Two conventional tracer (KBr and KI) tests and a tracer (NaCl) test in ground water tubes were conducted to study residence times and soil water flow characteristics. Online registration of electrical conductivity and temperature were used to analyse the NaCl experiment. The results showed clear spatial differences in 18O/16O distributions that were similar in each field campaign. Both 18O/16O and 2H/1H also varied clearly with depth until 40cm. The results indicate that a strong preferential pathway exists in the wetland and that the water flows mainly in the top of peat layer. The observed flow path was the reason for the varying NH4-N distribution showing that a large potential area for nutrient removal is not used. The results show that the isotope method can be used to evaluate the water flow structure in peatlands and determinate the active flow area for wastewater purification. Along with the tradistional tracer test the method can be used to estimate the active flow volume. A modification to the potential residence time equation is proposed by including active flow area, flow depth and an effective porosity.","2007-12-30","2025-01-08 20:47:06","2025-03-07 22:08:28","","418-429","","3","347","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6.4","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the contaminant transport through a treatment peatland receiving municipal wastewater.

The sites had been under loading for 10-16 years. About 20 peat samples for analyses of oxalate-extractable and total P, Al and Fe were collected from the depth 0-10 cm in each peatland. The peat P concentration ranged from 0.097 mg g-1 to 14 mg g-1 being 1.7 mg g-1on average. P accumulated in preferential flow path areas. Although P concentrations were locally high, DSSP (the index of potential soil P release from peat to water) was very low in all studied peatlands, indicating that peat was not saturated by phosphorus. The results indicate that Al-based precipitation chemicals increase substantially P retention capacity of peatland and maintain a stabile P reduction in spite of varying P loads. The results also show long-term phosphorus accumulation in peatlands polishing municipal wastewater from activated sludge treatment. The regression analyses showed that k-value for N removal depends on N loading and hydraulic loading. The first-order area model together with regression analysis of the rate constant result in a good agreement between observed and calculated nitrogen concentration.

Its reclamation will constitute the largest wetland reclamation project in Canadian history. We developed a unified analytical framework that we used to set reclamation targets and evaluate reclamation progress using submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV). We sampled SAV in 38 minimally disturbed wetlands to establish a reference condition and compared this to SAV in 25 reclamation wetlands. We observed 26 taxa: all were native and five are regionally rare. Using a combination of ordination, clustering, and indicator species analysis, we identified seven SAV assemblages, distinguishable based on 10 indicator species. The assemblages found in wetlands contaminated by tailings had significantly fewer taxa. Using joint plots, we demonstrate that they differ in terms of environmental variables reflecting depth, slope, salinity, transparency, water and sediment nutrient levels, and alkalinity. Collectively, 74% of reference wetlands had SAV belonging to either marsh or fen-marsh assemblages that we consider suitable targets for reclamation. Having multiple reclamation targets avoids creating a homogenous post-mining landscape with low gamma diversity. Using complementary multivariate and categorical tests, we found that reclamation wetlands failed to support either of these dominant reference assemblages. Instead, every reclamation wetland supported one of five atypical SAV assemblages, each of which was uncommon (<10%) among reference wetlands. The analytical framework we developed can be applied to other ecosystems or taxa to develop targets for reclamation, to evaluate reclamation progress, and to identify environmental characteristics associated with reclamation targets.","2011-04","2025-01-08 20:47:06","2025-03-12 17:27:20","","569-579","","4","37","","Ecol.

Reclamation plans call for > 15,000 ha of wetlands to be constructed, but currently, only about 25 wetlands are of suitable age for evaluation. Reclamation wetlands are typically of the shallow open water type and range from fresh to sub-saline. Tailings-contaminated wetlands in particular may have problems with hydrocarbon- and salt-related toxicity. From 60 initial candidate metrics in the submersed aquatic and floating vegetation communities, we selected five to quantify biological integrity. The IBI included two diversity-based metrics: the species richness of floating vegetation and the percent of total richness contributed by <i>Potamogeton </i>spp. It also included three relative abundance-based metrics: that of <i>Ceratophyllum demersum</i>, of floating leafed species and of alkali-tolerant species. We evaluated the contribution of nonlinear metrics to IBI performance but concluded that the correlation between IBI scores and wetland condition was not improved. The method used to score metrics had an influence on the IBI sensitivity. We conclude that continuous scoring relative to the distribution of values found in reference sites was superior. This scoring approach provided good sensitivity and resolution and was grounded in reference condition theory. Based on these IBI scores, both tailings-contaminated and tailings-free reclamation wetlands have significantly lower average biological integrity than reference wetlands (ANOVA: F (2,59) = 34.7, p = 0.000000000107).","2012-01","2025-01-08 20:47:06","2025-03-12 17:27:30","","749-761","","2","184","","Environ.

In boreal peatlands, vegetation indicates ecohydrological conditions of the ecosystem. Applying remote sensing would enable spatially and temporally continuous monitoring of peatland vegetation. New multi- and hyperspectral satellite data offer promising approaches for understanding the spectral properties of peatland vegetation at high temporal and spectral resolutions. However, using spectral satellite data to their fullest potential requires detailed spectral analyses of dominant species in peatlands. A dominant feature of peatland vegetation is the genus Sphagnum mosses. We investigated how the reflectance spectra of common boreal Sphagnum mosses, collected from waterlogged natural conditions after snowmelt, change when the mosses are desiccated. We conducted a laboratory experiment where the reflectance spectra (350–2500 nm) and the mass of 90 moss samples (representing nine species) were measured repetitively. Furthermore, we examined (i) their inter- and intraspecific spectral differences and (ii) whether the species or their respective habitats could be identified based on their spectral signatures in varying states of drying. Our findings show that the most informative spectral regions to retrieve information about the Sphagnum species and their state of desiccation are in the shortwave infrared region. Furthermore, the visible and near-infrared spectral regions contain less information on species and moisture content. Our results also indicate that hyperspectral data can, to a limited extent, be used to separate mosses belonging to meso- and ombrotrophic habitats. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of including data especially from the shortwave infrared region (1100–2500 nm) in remote sensing applications of boreal peatlands. The spectral library of Sphagnum mosses collected in this study is available as open data and can be used to develop new methods for remote monitoring of boreal peatlands.","2023","2025-01-08 20:47:06","2025-03-12 01:25:46","","e10197","","6","13","","Ecol.

However, in recent decades, many of these peatlands have been fragmented by access roads constructed for resource extraction and transportation, challenging their carbon storage potential. To investigate how roads have been impacting tree and shrub growth and productivity in these peatlands, this study was conducted in a forested bog and woody fen in Carmon Creek, Alberta, Canada. In 2017, vegetation surveys were conducted along 20 m transects that extended on both sides of the road with 4 m(2)circular plots at 2, 6 and 20 m distance from the road and were followed by disc or core collection from woody stems. Within 20 m of the road at the bog site, we observed a shift towards significantly larger radial growth of trees in the downstream areas (t= 3.23,p= 0.006) where water table position was deeper, while at the fen site, radial growth of tall shrubs had little response to the road. Combining the effects of direct tree clearing and hydrology induced shifts in growth, aboveground net primary productivity (NPPag) post-road construction was reduced significantly in areas where vegetation was cleared during the road construction (i.e., upstream areas of the bog:t= 5.21,p< 0.0001 and downstream areas of the fen:t= 2.64,p= 0.07). Substantially lower NPPag around the road construction areas compared to reference areas shows tremendous loss of carbon sink potential of trees and shrubs after road construction through peatlands. Altogether, roads constructed through peatlands perpendicular to the water flow may shift long-term carbon sinks into sources of carbon, at least for the initial few years following road construction.","2020-05","2025-01-08 20:47:06","2025-03-12 01:56:53","","","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.9","2","SC: 0000011","<p>- This paper examines how roads change water table and flooging in peatlands and the consequent effects on carbon relations and vegetation.</p>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; vegetation; carbon cycle; primary productivity; roads; culverts; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a multi-year study at two boreal peatlands – a forested bog and a shrubby rich fen near Peace River, Alberta – to study the impacts of resource access roads on the hydrology of adjacent peatland. Field measurements (bi-weekly depth to water table and hydraulic head, one-time hydraulic conductivity) during the growing seasons (May-August) of 2016 and 2017 were taken from sampling plots representing: 1) sides of the road (upstream and downstream); 2) distance from the road (obstruction); and 3) distance from culverts. Compared to the growing season average precipitation for the region of 1.8 mm d−1, the study period had very wet conditions in 2016 (3.7 mm d−1) and dry conditions in 2017 (1.1 mm d−1). In contrast to our assumptions, resource access road disturbed the surface and sub-surface water flow at the bog, but the effect was minimal at the fen as the road orientation was nearly parallel to the flow direction at the latter. At the bog, the shallowest depth to water table position was observed at upstream areas closer to the road, when culverts were located >20 m distance from transects. In contrast, when culverts were present <2 m from the transects, variation in hydrological conditions between upstream and downstream areas were greatly reduced. Our work shows road effects on peatland hydrology could be minimized by aligning roads parallel to the water flow direction when possible. If water flow is perpendicular to the road, adequate spacing and installation of culverts could help to reduce flow obstruction.","2020","2025-01-08 20:47:06","2025-03-07 22:08:30","","","","","584","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6.4","1","","<p>- This paper presents an indepth study of the impacts of roads on the hydrology of peatlands and proposes mitigation techniques to avoid impacts.</p>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; other wetland; groundwater; water table; impact minimization; roads; mitigation hierarchy; culverts; watercourses; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, at the fen, both RI areas (-744.7, -310.9 g C m(-2) y(-1) in 2016 and 2017, respectively) and reference areas were sinks of C. Averaged across both peatlands, the estimated road-induced C losses were similar to 7.97 and 7.40 Mg C for each km of the road in 2016 and 2017, respectively. However, areas connected by culverts showed lower road-associated impact on C emissions. Therefore, we suggest that industries and infrastructure developers align the road parallel to the local water flow direction, when possible, consider the hydrogeological setting during road design to reduce hydrologic impacts, and increase hydrological flows between up- and downstream by adequate culverts. Plain Language Summary The boreal region of Canada has significant numbers of resource access roads passing through peatlands. Undisturbed peatlands are globally important reservoirs of carbon (C, a component of carbon dioxide i.e., associated with global warming). In this study, we determined the impacts of resource access roads in two boreal forested peatlands (a bog and a fen) on C dynamics from the adjacent peatland. Our results showed that, at the bog, the road impacted areas were sources of carbon in both study years. However, in both study years, the fen was a sink of C. At both sites, the road-impacted areas had less C uptake than undisturbed areas and this was caused by both the road affecting the wetness of the peatland and due to clearing of shrubs and trees adjacent to the road. Our study estimated road induced C losses were similar to 7,970 and 7,400 kg C for each km of the road in 2016 and 2017, respectively. This study will help industries and infrastructure developers improve road construction design by considering the hydrogeological setting to reduce hydrologic impacts and increase hydrological flows between upstream and downstream areas through adequate culverts.","2023-01","2025-01-08 20:47:06","2025-03-07 22:08:29","","","","1","128","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.7","2","","<p>- This paper examines the impacts of a road and its changes to water table (flooding and drainage) on peatland vegetation and carbon relations. </p>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; vegetation; water table; flooding; drawdown; carbon cycle; impact minimization; roads; mitigation hierarchy; culverts; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A series of one-dimensional consolidation, direct simple shear, and bender element tests are conducted to investigate the compressibility and the monotonic shear strength of a peat deposit from the Port Lands area of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Laboratory specimens are trimmed from block samples collected from a depth of about 4.0 to 4.5 m. The samples' organic content ranges from about 42% to 60%, with a fiber content of 20% to 30%. Because of their moderate organic and water (180%–237%) contents, the peat samples are found to be less compressible with a slower consolidation rate than several other surficial peat deposits reported in the literature. All samples exhibit a ductile shearing behaviour with undrained strength ratios ranging from 0.32 to 0.57 and a residual effective friction angle of about 30°. The monotonic tests are further examined within the framework of critical state soil mechanics.

This study will examine dissolution mechanisms of chromitite in various acidic, neutral, and alkaline solutions containing cultivated bacteria, manganese oxides, sulfates, and phosphates. Dissolution of chromitite is non-stoichiometric under acidic, near-neutral, and alkaline pH conditions and involves the release of chromite nanoparticles and complex dissolution/re-precipitation reactions. Chromitite samples are obtained from the Black Thor chromite deposit in Northern Ontario, Canada; part of the ""Ring of Fire"" intrusive complex. The examined chromitite is composed of chromite, (Fe (sub 0.5) Mg (sub 0.5) ) (Al (sub 0.6) Cr (sub 1.4) )O (sub 4) and clinochlore; Mg (sub 3) [Si (sub 4) O (sub 10) (OH) (sub 2) ].[MgAl (sub 1.33) (OH) (sub 6) ], the latter phase contains approximately 3 wt% Cr in the form of chromite nanoparticles. Bulk dissolution data are collected after dissolution experiments with chromitite powders, and the chemical and mineralogical composition of treated chromitite surfaces is characterized with a combination of surface analytical techniques (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and nano- to micro-analytical techniques (scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and focused ion beam technology). In the chromitite systems studied here, the non-stoichiometric dissolution of clinochlore is the dominant reaction, which results in the formation of a hydrous and porous silica precipitate that is depleted in chromite nanoparticles relative to untreated clinochlore. Complete replacement of clinochlore by hydrous silica on the surface of chromitite under acidic conditions promotes the release of chromite nanoparticles and results in higher Cr:Si in solutions and in higher proportions of secondary Cr species on its surface (secondary Cr species are defined as surface terminations that do not occur on an untreated chromite surface, such as -Cr (super 3+) -OH (sub 2) and -Cr (super 6+) -OH). Cultivated bacteria from a sulfide-bearing acid-mine drainage system affect neither the degree of dissolution nor the formation of secondary Cr species, whereas pyrolusite (MnO (sub 2) ) particles, and adsorbed or precipitated Fe- and Al-bearing hydroxide, -sulfate, and -phosphate species, affect release and re-adsorption of chromite nanoparticles and Cr-bearing species during dissolution of chromitite under acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions. These results show that weathering of chromitite and the release of Cr into the environment are strongly controlled by factors such as dissolution rates of Cr-bearing silicates and chromite, the release of chromite nanoparticles, re-precipitation of amorphous silica, the presence of particles in solution, and the pH-dependence adsorption (or precipitation) of Fe- and Al-bearing hydroxides and sulfates.","2018","2025-01-08 20:47:07","2025-03-07 18:21:45","","271-283","","2","103","","Am.

To avoid further land degradation, the rewetting of peatlands is essential. The new land use concept of paludiculture - the use of wet and rewetted peatlands for agriculture and forestry - now offers possibilities for landowners and land managers to continue using these sites under wet conditions. But new challenges arise due to the limited bearing capacity of wet soils, which restricts accessibility for machinery. Whilst many site-specific technical solutions for harvesting on wet peatland are available, it remains unclear whether current machinery is suitable for use in the large-scale implementation of paludiculture. Repeated crossings of the same ground can easily disturb the upper peat layer and cause serious problems for the removal of biomass. In this article we present available machinery and approaches to biomass harvesting; and explore how the number of transport runs required for biomass removal varies with productivity of the site, cargo capacity and working width of the harvesting machinery. The results are used in a discussion of logistics and infrastructure requirements to facilitate the implementation of paludiculture. Whilst there is still considerable scope for improvement of harvesting technologies, our results show that a peat-conserving harvest from wet and rewetted peatlands is possible with adjustments to harvesting technique, logistics and site infrastructure.","2015","2025-01-08 20:47:07","2025-09-02 19:44:45","","1-18","","13","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1.2","4","SC: 0000039","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the challenges of using heavy equipment on rewetted peatlands and presents approaches to avoid damage to vegetation.</p> </div>","","","peatland; vegetation; peat; substrate disturbance; impact minimization; compaction; mitigation hierarchy; industrial equipment; agriculture; substrate; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these runoff control techniques have not been well characterized, particularly during the snowmelt period. Therefore, patterns of runoff timing and magnitude were evaluated in a peatland (Bois-des-Bel, Quebec, Canada) undergoing restoration (restored site), in comparison with an unrestored section of the same peatland (unrestored site). Snowmelt dominated runoff, representing over 79% of the April to August runoff for both sites in 2001. Low (25-35 cm) bunds constructed on the restored site detained water for much of the melt period, but some water loss occurred where bunds were breached. Overland flow and surface ponding were prevalent at the restored site, but were not evident at the unrestored site. At the restored site, the presence of bunds and frozen, saturated (thus impermeable) ground contributed to differences in snowmelt runoff patterns relative to the unrestored site. In the post-snowmelt period (May-August 2001 and 2002), restored site runoff was reduced to 25% of that lost at the unrestored site. Both hydrometric and chemical hydrograph separation analysis using electrical conductivity indicated that blocked ditches restricted water losses from much of the restored site during the summer months, when the bunds had little effect on runoff. However, discharge peaks were greater at the restored site relative to the unrestored site and generally occurred more quickly following rainfall, because of the wetter antecedent condition.","2006","2025-01-08 20:47:07","2025-03-07 22:07:55","","3799-3814","","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.2","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of peatland restoration using the moss layer transfer technique on the hydrological storage and surface runoff from the peatland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; substrate disturbance; active restoration; mitigation hierarchy; peat dams; surface water/runoff; hydrological management; revegetation; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One year of pre-restoration monitoring (1999) and three years of post restoration monitoring were done at the Bois-des-Bel peatland near Riviere-du-Loup, Quebec, to evaluate hydrological changes that occurred at a managed section (restored site) relative to an adjacent abandoned section of the same peatland (unrestored site). Restored site evaporation was 74%, 74%, and 98% of unrestored site evaporation in 2000, 2001, and 2002, while runoff at the restored site was 83%, 30%, and 12% of unrestored site runoff over the same period. Seasonal soil volume change (swelling and shrinking of the peat) was evident at the restored site indicating rewetting of the peat profile despite the prolonged period between site abandonment and the initiation of the restoration measures (19 years). Site rewetting may have benefited from the relatively deep layer of residual peat (around 1.5m). Higher seasonal mean water table and soil moisture were observed at the restored site relative to the unrestored site in 2000 through 2002 along with increased seasonal variability at the former location. Mean soil–water pressure was also higher than at the unrestored site and the range decreased, both spatially and on a seasonal and daily basis.

The conventional treatment technologies used in the treatment of acid mine drainage are expensive both in terms of operating and capital costs. One of the methods of achieving compliance using passive treatment systems at low cost, producing treated water pollution free, and fostering a community responsibility for acid mine water treatment involves the use of wetland treatment system. These wetlands absorb and bind heavy metals and make them slowly concentrated in the sedimentary deposits to become part of the geological cycle. In this paper a critical review of the heavy metal removal mechanism involving various physical, chemical and biological processes, which govern wetland performance, have been made.

The range in Al concentrations (8–247 mg/kg) indicates that the dust contents of the berries are highly variable; this is seen also with other conservative, lithophile elements. Comparing TE concentrations with those of Al reveals two main types of geochemical behaviours: TEs which vary almost exclusively with dust inputs, and TEs which are largely independent of them. Micronutrients such as Cu, Zn, Ni and Mo are unaffected by dust; these elements are dominated by plant uptake from the substrate. Potentially toxic light metals are either dominated by dust inputs (Li) or independent of them (Be). The same is true of potentially toxic heavy metals: Pb is strongly correlated with Al (r = 0.901, n = 31) whereas Tl is not (r = 0.329, n = 19). In respect to elements enriched in bitumen (V, Ni and Mo), V in the berries is proportional to Al (r = 0.969, n = 31) whereas Ni and Mo are not (r = 0.040 and 0.027, respectively; n = 31); their concentrations in the berries are dictated by root uptake. Comparing the Pb/Y and V/Y ratios to the corresponding values for the Upper Continental Crust shows that neither element is enriched in the berries. Data for berries from remote locations and commercial growers help to place the results obtained from reclaimed lands into perspective. For example, the greatest concentrations of Mn, Cd, Ni and Mo, were found in berries from rural and remote locations.","2020-03-01","2025-01-08 20:47:07","2025-03-12 01:55:17","","105960","","","110","","Ecol.

Open pit bitumen mining and upgrading of the Athabasca Bituminous Sands (ABS), the largest of the deposits, began in 1967. Concerns about fugitive release of trace elements (TEs) to the environment began with studies of V, as this is the most abundant trace metal in bitumen. Recent studies, however, have extended to Ag, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Sb, and Tl, and this has led to considerable confusion about which TEs are relevant to ecosystem health. While V along with Ni, Mo, Se and Re are enriched in bitumen, Ag, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Sb and Tl are found almost exclusively in the mineral (i.e. sand) fraction of the ABS, with limited opportunity to become bioaccessible, much less bioavailable. Here, a summary is given of ten misunderstandings that have arisen regarding TEs in the environment of the ABS region.

However, chemical analyses of TEs in peat provide little information about their ecological significance, subsequent to atmospheric deposition. There is potential for the most reactive dusts and aerosols to dissolve in acidic (pH 4), organic-rich, bog water, thereby releasing TEs. Here, we use TEs in bog waters as indicators of the chemical reactivity of atmospheric particles. Porewaters were sampled from bogs i) near open pit bitumen mines of northern Alberta (AB) known to have elevated rates of dust deposition, primarily in the form of coarse particles, and ii) in southern Ontario (ONT), known to have had elevated rates of Pb deposition since industrialization began, supplied mainly as fine aerosols. In the AB bog waters, the elements most often elevated in abundance, relative to the reference site (Utikuma), are Li and Fe, most likely due to proton-promoted and reductive dissolution of their mineral hosts, respectively. In the bog waters collected in ONT, Pb concentrations and enrichments (relative to Y), are far greater than the AB bogs, reflecting the profound differences in cumulative inputs of industrial Pb in the two regions combined with proton-promoted dissolution of Pb-bearing aerosols. Given the affinity of natural organic matter for Pb ions, surface complexation and ligand-promoted dissolution also may have played a role in Pb release. Regardless of the dissolution mechanisms involved, peatland waters provide new insight into the chemical reactivity of dusts and aerosols. These transformations may have broader significance for the chemical composition of peatland drainage waters, and the organic-rich receiving waters of the boreal zone.","2023","2025-01-08 20:47:08","2025-03-12 01:56:43","","2401-2416","","9","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SC: 0000006","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper determines the best trace metal indicators of air pollution originating from Alberta oil sands.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; mining; bog; monitoring; pollution; air pollution; fugitive dust; biomonitoring; metal/metalloid; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For comparison, this moss was also collected in central AB, in the vicinity of the City of Edmonton which is approximately 500km to the south of the ABS region, from the Wagner Wetland which is 22km W of the City, from Seba Beach (ca. 90km W) and from Elk Island National Park (ca. 45km E). All of the moss samples were digested and trace elements concentrations determined using ICP-SMS at a commercial laboratory, with selected samples also analyzed using instrumental neutron activation analysis at the University of Alberta. The mosses from the ABS region yielded lower concentrations of Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb, Tl, and Zn compared to the moss from the Edmonton area. Concentrations of Ni and Mo in the mosses were comparable in these two regions, but V was more abundant in the ABS samples. Compared with the surface vegetation of eight peat cores collected in recent years from British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, the mean concentrations of Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl and Zn in the mosses from the ABS region are generally much lower. In fact, the concentrations of these trace elements in the samples from the ABS region are comparable to the corresponding values in forest moss from remote regions of central and northern Norway. Lithophile element concentrations (Ba, Be, Ga, Ge, Li, Sc, Th, Ti, Zr) explain most of the variation in trace metal concentrations in the moss samples. The mean concentrations of Th and Zr are greatest in the moss samples from the ABS region, reflecting dust inputs to the bogs from open pit mines, aggregate quarries, and gravel roads. Linear regressions of V, Ni, and Mo (elements enriched in bitumen) versus Sc (a conservative, lithophile element) show excellent correlations in the mosses from the ABS region, but this is true also of Ag, Pb, Sb and Tl: thus, most of the variation in the trace metal concentrations can be explained simply by the abundance of dust particles on the plants of this region. Unlike the moss samples from the ABS region and from UTK where Pb/Sc ratios resemble those of crustal rocks, the moss samples from the other regions studied yielded much greater Pb/Sc ratios implying significant anthropogenic Pb contributions at these other sites.","2016-07-01","2025-01-08 20:47:08","2025-02-10 13:42:05","","494-506","","","92-93","","Environ.

The purpose of the comparison was to distinguish between dust inputs to the berries versus plant uptake from the substrate, and to determine the natural abundance of trace elements in native berries. Using Al as an indicator of the abundance of soil-derived mineral particles, the abundance of dust on the surface of the berries is 20 to 29× lower than that of the substrate (moss). Other lithophile elements (V, Cr, Co, Ga, Li and Y) show similar differences between moss and berry. The concentrations of Rb and Ba in berries were similar to moss and Sr within a factor of 3 to 4×, probably reflecting passive uptake of these lithophile elements by the plants, even though they have no known physiological function. Of the micronutrients examined (Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Mo), Cu and Mn were more abundant in berries than moss, Ni and Zn yielded similar concentrations in both whereas Fe followed by Mo showed the greatest concentration difference. For these micronutrients, uptake by the plants through their roots via the substrate (moss and peat) outweighs contributions from atmospheric dusts. In respect to potentially toxic “heavy metals”, Pb concentrations in the moss (BMW, 89 ± 7.3 μg/kg; CMW, 93 ± 27 μg/kg) are below the natural, “background” values reported for ancient layers of Swiss peat from the mid-Holocene (>6000 years old). The Pb concentrations in the berries, however, are 19 to 47× lower than in the underlying moss indicating that Pb in the berries, like Al, is exclusively supplied by dust. Cadmium in the berries is at or above the level found in moss due to active uptake by the plants from the substrate, most likely because of the chemical similarity of this element to Zn. Silver, Sb and Tl in the berries were <LOD, but assuming that they are supplied exclusively by dust inputs, their concentrations in the berries can be estimated from the Al concentrations. Taken together, these data provide an estimate of the natural abundance of these elements in berries, based on measured (Cd, Pb) and calculated (Ag, Sb, Tl) values.","2019-02-10","2025-01-08 20:47:08","2025-03-12 01:56:25","","1652-1663","","","650","","Sci.

The surface layers of bogs, which are dominated by living plants and poorly decomposed fibrous peats, are especially problematic. To extract peat monoliths, we use a Belarus corer for deep layers and a Wardenaar device for surface layers. Both corers are constructed using titanium alloys to improve strength, reduce weight, and minimize the risk of contamination by the trace metals of environmental relevance. In this review, we include detailed drawings of the Belarus corer and photographs of the modifications to the Wardenaar corer. Modifications to the motorized Noernberg corer for frozen peat are described, and a complete set of drawings provided.

A randomized block design was used to evaluate the effect of various revegetation practices, including augmenting natural recovery with the use of native transplants, acrotelm transfer from a similar intact donor peatland, and the use of variable surface microtopography. Although overall survival of transplants was similar between areas smoothed and left rough, areas that were rough had greater species richness under natural recovery, including trees, shrubs, and other perennial herbs. Moreover, survival and growth of woody transplants (Picea mariana—black spruce and Ledum groenlandicum—Labrador tea) were greater when planted within the top and middle microtopographic positions rather than micro-depressions. Survival of transplanted sedges (Carex spp.) was high at all topographic positions, but benefited the most in growth from planting in depressions. Contrary to expectations, no benefits of acrotelm application were found on vegetation recovery during the first two seasons, and even reduced the presence of some native vegetation.

We used a large number of field measurements, multisource satellite, climate and topographic data and a machine learning algorithm to produce the first wall-to-wall estimates of C stocks and uncertainties in plants and soils of Canada at 250 m spatial resolution.

SFW is a 52-ha system atop soft-tailings that includes an inflow/outflow pump system, underdrains, upland hummocks, and a fen lowland. In this study, water table dynamics of the fen lowland were evaluated in the 2 years following commissioning (2014–2015) to assess whether this newly constructed watershed has hydrological conditions that facilitate hydric soils with water table regimes similar to reference systems. Results indicate that the location and hydrophysical properties of placed materials control water table responses to both water management and precipitation. This differential water table response in the SFW lowland drove lateral fluxes between adjacent landforms, suggesting periods of intermittent water supply from uplands to wetlands along hummock margins. As in natural systems, the lowland fen exhibited several lateral flow reversals over the 2 years depending upon water level. Water tables on-average were greater than those observed in natural analogues.

Using input-output budgets, we found that prior to flooding, the wetland complex was a net source of approximately 1.7 mg MeHg ha(-1) yr(-1) to downstream ecosystems. In the first year of flooding, net yields of MeHg from the reservoir increased 40-fold to approximately 70 mg MeHg ha(-1) yr(-1). Subsequently, annual net yields of MeHg from the reservoir declined (10-50 mg MeHg ha(-1) yr(-1)) but have remained well above natural levels. The magnitude and timing of Hg methylation in the flooded peat portion of the wetland reservoir were very different than in the open water region of the reservoir. In terms of magnitude, net Hg methylation rates in the peat in the first 2 years of flooding were 2700 mg ha(-1) yr(-1), constituting over 97% of the MeHg produced at the whole-ecosystem level. But in the following 3 years, there was a large decrease in the mass of MeHg in the flooded peat due to microbial demethylation. In contrast, concentrations of MeHg in the open water region and in zooplankton, and body burdens of Hg in cyprinid fish, remained high for the full 9 years of this study. Microbial activity in the open water region also remained high, as evidenced by continued high concentrations of dissolved CO2 and CH4. Thus, the large short-term accumulation of MeHg mass in the peat appeared to have only a small influence on concentrations of MeHg in the biota; rather MeHg accumulation in biota was sustained by the comparatively small ongoing net methylation of Hg in the flooded pond where microbial activity remained high. In large reservoirs, where the effects of wind and fetch are greater than in the small experimental reservoir we constructed, differences can occur in the timing and extent of peat and soil erosion, effecting either transport of MeHg to the food chain or the fueling of microbial activity in open water sediments, both of which could have important long-term implications for MeHg concentrations in predatory fish.","2004-03-01","2025-01-08 20:47:10","2025-03-10 17:42:37","","1348-1358","","5","38","","Environ.

The North American boreal forest is no exception to this global trend, and there are growing concerns regarding the persistence of linear anthropogenic features across Canada because of their negative impacts on wildlife and, particularly, on threatened species such as the boreal caribou. While many recent studies have investigated the state and distribution of regeneration on seismic lines in the western part of the country, few studies have characterized the natural regrowth of logging roads, the main type of anthropogenic linear features found in eastern Canada. As seismic lines and logging roads are structurally different, results from seismic line studies may not be easily generalized to logging roads. In this study, we therefore 1) assessed the influence of different characteristics on vegetation regrowth composition and 2) determined which environmental drivers may compromise natural regrowth on logging roads. We tested these questions using data collected from 56 1-km long road segments distributed in three different regions across Quebec's boreal forest (eastern Canada). We used a canonical correspondence analysis to characterize the species composition of vegetation regrowth on logging roads and used mixed regression models to assess the influence of different biotic and abiotic variables on regrowth establishment. The number of growing degree-days and the proportion of coniferous stands in the surroundings of a road segment explained most of the variation in species composition of the vegetation on roads. Regrowth composition on roads was distributed along a gradient shifting from a high number of alder stems (in the region with a higher number of degree-days) and a smaller proportion of coniferous stands (surrounding the road segment) to a higher number of coniferous stems in regions experiencing less growing degree-days where road segments were surrounded by a greater proportion of coniferous stands. Soil compaction was the most important variable impeding the establishment of vegetation on logging roads. A greater proportion of wetlands surrounding the road segment also contributed to poor regrowth. Our results underline the slow rate of passive regeneration of logging roads and the importance of road surface decommissioning, which should include tree planting, in the context of woodland caribou habitat restoration.","2021-02","2025-01-08 20:47:10","2025-03-07 22:07:54","","","","","482","","For.

The decommissioning of anthropogenic linear features and the restoration of suitable habitat are top priorities for the recovery of several species at risk, among which, the threatened populations of boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). However, the decommissioning of linear features found in caribou range is expensive, and determining which characteristics make them more beneficial to caribou predators and competitors could assist in prioritizing those that may be most critical for boreal caribou habitat restoration. We thus aimed to determine how fine-scale forest road characteristics influence their use by gray wolf (Canis lupus), black bear (<i>Ursus americanus</i>), moose (Alces americanus) and caribou. We used camera traps and generalized linear mixed models to test the effect of road-scale characteristics on the use of forest roads by wolves, bears and moose while also considering largerscale covariates. Wolves had a greater probability of using roads that were surrounded by wetlands and had a low lateral cover density. For bears, the intensity of use was lower on 20+ year-old roads when compared to 0-10-year-old roads, and higher on roads surrounded by coniferous stands. Moose intensity of use was higher on 11-20-year-old roads and lower on 30+ year-old roads, and decreased on roads surrounded by clearcuts and with a lower number of deciduous stems growing on them. We could not test for caribou use as we did not capture enough events. Nevertheless, by showing which forest roads are more used by caribou predators (wolves and bears) and its apparent competitor (moose), our study highlights the importance of considering both road-scale characteristics and the landscape context in which roads are built to prioritize the most detrimental roads to caribou conservation and guide efficient restoration efforts of its habitat.","2022-04","2025-01-08 20:47:10","2025-03-12 01:24:50","","","","","510","","For.

Mass-balance estimates using methyl mercury inputs in wet deposition and outputs in runoff water indicated that purely upland catchments and lakes were sites of methyl mercury retention or demethylation, while catchments with wetland areas were sites of net methyl mercury production. These observations may explain the high concentrations of mercury in fish taken from lakes that are high in colour because they receive water from wetlands. There was no relationship between the concentration of total mercury and the concentration of methyl mercury in runoff water. Total mercury yields were low from a wetland-dominated catchment, higher from a combination upland/riparian wetland catchment, and highest from a purely upland catchment. The opposite was true for methyl mercury yields from these same catchments. This indicates that environmental factors other than total mercury concentration are controlling the production and loss of methyl mercury from catchments.","1994","2025-01-08 20:47:11","2025-03-07 22:07:12","","1065-1076","","5","51","","Can.

However, due to their intimate association with wet environments, wet soils are at risk of degradation during drought events. This review investigates the effects of drought on wet soils, with particular attention to the changes in soil geochemistry and greenhouse gas emissions. It is clear from this review that drought poses a significant threat to wet soils, a threat which can be difficult to determine before an event but which poses a catastrophic risk to some sites. Drought causes oxygen penetration to increase in wet soils, leading to an increase in oxidation of organic matter and reduced inorganic species (e.g. sulfides). Oxidation of these materials can lead to soil acidification, metal mobilization and to negative impacts on water quality. Increased oxygen in the soil profile also affects biogeochemical cycling, with increased production of nitrous oxide and decreased production of methane. Effects of drought differ between peat and mineral soil types and subtypes. Wet soils undergo major chronological transformations and biogeochemical changes in the alteration of environments occurring before, during and after drought conditions. Water conditions (i.e. subaqueous, saturated, unsaturated and resaturated) also play a major role in chronological soil transformations. Soils may not easily recover between severe droughts and instead enter alternative stable states. This review highlights substantial gaps in our understanding of the effects of drought on wet soils and shows that previous studies overrepresent relatively small geographical regions.","2020-11","2025-01-08 20:47:11","2025-03-12 01:55:19","","","","","210","","Earth-Sci.

We measured bulk density, water table, soil temperature, plant cover, and CO2 and CH4 flux along triplicate transects crossing a winter road through a wooded fen near Peace River, Alberta, Canada. Sample plots were located 1, 5, and 10 m from the road on both sides with an additional three plots on the road. Productivity of the overstory trees, when present, was also determined. The winter road had higher bulk density, shallower water table, higher graminoid cover, and thawed earlier than the adjacent peatland. Tree productivity and CO2 flux varied between the plots, and there was no clear pattern in relation to distance from the road. The plots on the winter road acted as a greater CO2 sink and greater CH4 source compared to the adjacent peatland with plots on the winter road emitting on average (standard error) 479 (138) compared to 41 (10) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in the adjacent peatland.

Peatland carbon cycling is affected by water table position which is predicted to be lowered by climate change. Therefore we compared carbon fluxes along a natural peatland microtopographic gradient (control) to an adjacent microtopographic gradient with an experimentally lowered water table (experimental) during three growing seasons to assess the impact of water table drawdown on peatland-atmosphere carbon exchange. Water table drawdown induced peat subsidence and a change in the vegetation community at the experimental site. This limited differences in carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange between the control and experimental sites resulting in no significant differences between sites after three seasons. However, there was a trend to higher respiration rates and increased productivity in low-lying zones (hollows) and this was coincident with increased vegetation cover at these plots. In general, CH4 efflux was reduced at the experimental site, although CH4 efflux from control and experimental hollows remained similar throughout the study. The differential response of carbon cycling to the water table drawdown along the microtopographic gradient resulted in local topographic high zones (hummocks) experiencing a relative increase in global warming potential (GWP) of 152%, while a 70% reduction in GWP was observed at hollows. Thus the distribution and composition of microtopographic elements, or microforms, within a peatland is important for determining how peatland carbon cycling will respond to climate change.","2007","2025-01-08 20:47:11","2025-03-07 18:21:37","","","","","21","","Global Biogeochem.

The objective of this study was to determine how net production and export of DOC from a northern peatland may be affected by disturbance such as drainage and climate change. The study was conducted at a poor fen containing several pool-ridge complexes: (1) control site-no water table manipulation; (2) experimental site-monitored for one season in a natural state and then subjected to a water table drawdown for 3 years; (3) drained site-subjected to a water table drawdown 9 years prior to monitoring. The DOC concentration was measured in pore water along a microtopographic gradient at each site (hummock, lawn and hollow), in standing water in pools, and in discharge from the experimental and drained sites. The initial water table drawdown released 3 g of carbon per square metre in the form of DOC, providing a large pulse of DOC to downstream ecosystems. This value, however, represents only 1-9% of ecosystem respiration at this site. Seasonal losses of DOC following drainage were 8-11 g of carbon per square metre, representing 17% of the total carbon exchange at the experimental study site. Immediately following water table drawdown, DOC concentrations were elevated in pore water and open water pools. In subsequent seasons, DOC concentration in the pool declined, but remained higher than the control site even 11 years after water-table drawdown. This suggests continued elevated net DOC production under lower water table conditions likely related to an increase in vegetation biomass and larger water table fluctuations at the experimental and drained sites. However, the increase in concentration was limited to initially wet microforms (lawns and hollows) reflecting differences in vegetation community changes, water table and soil subsidence along the microtopographic gradient.

To address these issues, the vegetation community was described, and the rates of gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), ecosystem respiration (R-tot) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange were determined along poor fen microtopographic gradients at a control site and at a site which experienced a water table drawdown of similar to 20 cm 8 years prior to the study (drained). Sampling plots within these sites were classified as microforms of hummocks, lawns, or hollows. The coverage of Sphagnum moss declined on drained hummocks, drained lawns were invaded by sedges, and hollows shifted from open water plots at the control site to <i>Sphagnum</i>-dominated plots with sparse vascular plant cover at the drained site. As a result, Rtot was significantly greater at the drained site at all microforms while maximum rates of GEP declined at drained hummocks and were enhanced at drained lawns and hollows compared to similar control microforms.

Climate models predict that evapotranspiration will increase under a 2 × CO<sub>2</sub> scenario due to increased temperatures leading to lowered water tables at many northern latitudes. Given that the position of the water table within a peatland can have a large effect on CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, climate change may alter the CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from peatlands in this area. Research was conducted during 2001–2003 on natural and drained (8 years prior) sites within a poor fen in central Quebec. Flux measurements were made for each site at different microtopographical features that varied in depth to water table and vegetation cover. The quantity of CH<sub>4</sub> dissolved in the pore water was measured in the field and the potential of the peat for CH<sub>4</sub> production and consumption was determined in the laboratory. Methane emissions and storage were lower in the drained fen. Growing season CH<sub>4</sub> emissions at the drained site were 55% lower than the control site, primarily due to significantly reduced fluxes from topographic highs (up to 97% reduction), while the flux from topographically low areas remained high. The maintenance of high fluxes at these hollow sites was related to hydrological and ecological effects of the water table drawdown. The removal of standing water removed a potential zone of CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation. It also enabled plant colonization at these locations, leading to an increase in gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP). At the hollow sites, seasonal CH<sub>4</sub> emissions were significantly correlated to seasonal GEP (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.85). These results suggest that the response of northern peatland CH<sub>4</sub> dynamics to climate change depends on the antecedent moisture conditions of the site. Moreover, ecological succession can play an important role for determining future CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, particularly from wetter sites.","2004","2025-01-08 20:47:11","2025-03-07 18:27:45","","","","4","18","","Global Biogeochem.

Disturbance and restoration of peatland ecosystems alters ecohydrological conditions that are likely to affect DOC chemistry in both soil water and discharge, although the direction of change and controls on DOC chemistry post-restoration remain unclear. We investigated DOC chemistry (concentration, SUVA(254), E2:E3, E4:E6, pentose and hexose concentration) during the growing season (May to October) in soil and discharge of a peatland restored for 10 years and compared the results to those measured at neighboring unrestored and natural peatland sites. Controls on the spatial and temporal variability of DOC chemistry, including pH, water table, temperature, plant cover and type, and carbon dioxide and methane flux were also investigated. After 10 years, restoration increased DOC concentration in soils compared to both natural and unrestored sites. This high DOC concentration likely resulted from high plant productivity post-restoration and a mean water table position deeper than the natural site. Ecohydrological conditions were also correlated to DOC chemistry. High vascular plant cover and photosynthesis rates were correlated to lower SUVA(254) and higher pentose concentration, while deeper water table position was correlated to higher E2:E3 and E4:E6. DOC concentration in discharge was lower, and E2:E3 higher, at the restored compared to the unrestored site. Differences in DOC chemistry in discharge water were minimal between the sites except when water was likely sourced from the near surface layer at the restored site, which represents new peat accumulated post-restoration. These results suggest that DOC dynamics 10 years post-restoration remain intermediate between natural and unrestored peatland. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We determined the annual carbon balance of a former horticulturally-extracted peatland restored 10 yr prior to the study and compared these values to the carbon balance measured at neighboring unrestored and natural sites. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured using the chamber technique biweekly during the growing season from May to October 2010 and three times over the winter period. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export was measured from remnant ditches in the unrestored and restored sites. During the growing season the restored site had greater uptake of CO2 than the natural site when photon flux density was greater than 1000 μmol m−2 s−1, while the unrestored site remained a source of CO2. Ecosystem respiration was similar between natural and restored sites, which were both significantly lower than the unrestored site. Methane flux remained low at the restored site except from open water pools, created as part of restoration, and remnant ditches. Export of DOC during the growing season was 5.0 and 28.8 g m−2 from the restored and unrestored sites, respectively. Due to dry conditions during the study year all sites acted as net carbon sources with annual balance of the natural, restored and unrestored sites of 250.7, 148.0 and 546.6 g C m−2, respectively. Although hydrological conditions and vegetation community at the restored site remained intermediate between natural and unrestored conditions, peatland restoration resulted in a large reduction in annual carbon loss from the system resulting in a carbon balance more similar to a natural peatland.","2013","2025-01-08 20:47:12","2025-03-07 22:07:56","","2885-2896","","5","10","","Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","4.9","2","","<p>- This paper examines the greenhouse gases and carbon balance from a peat extraction peatland 10 years after having been restored using the moss layer transfer technique.<br/>- The restored peatland is intermediate between a natural peatland and a post-exracted peatland but is still not a carbon sink.</p>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; greenhouse gases; substrate disturbance; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; active restoration; dissolved organic carbon; mitigation hierarchy; revegetation; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particulate matter and trace elements can be emitted from potential mining activities and these air pollutants are associated with health risks and harmful to the sensitive ecosystem. An air monitoring station, powered by solar panels and a wind turbine, was established in this near-pristine area to monitor baseline levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and trace elements downwind of a proposed mine site. Levels of PM2.5 and trace elements observed from 2015 to 2018 were much lower than measurements observed in southern Ontario, suggesting minimal influence of primary emissions in the study area. One episodic PM2.5 event in July 2015 was attributable to wildfire emissions in northern Ontario. Only 8 out of the 31 target elements were detected in 25% or more of the samples. Good correlations among As, Se, Pb, and Sb, between Mn and Fe, as well as between Ce and La indicated they originated from long-range atmospheric transport from the south. Ontario's Ambient Air Quality Criteria were not exceeded for any target air pollutants. Four years of air measurements filled the data gap of baseline information in this near-pristine study area and can be used to assess impacts of potential mining activities in the future. Field operations during this study period indicated that the battery-powered air instruments and meteorological sensors worked well in the harsh environment of Ontario's Far North even in cold winter months. The field experiences gained in this study can be applied to future air monitoring activities in harsh environments where no direct power supply is available and site access is limited.","2021-07","2025-01-08 20:47:12","2025-03-12 17:04:25","","","","13","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>- This paper presents the baseline conditions of atmospheric deposition in peatlands in the Ring of Fire region.</p>","","","Canada; Ontario; peatland; contaminant transport; monitoring; pollution; air pollution; fugitive dust; Boreal Shield; Ring-of-Fire; Hudson Bay Lowland; reference conditions; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AII areas were drained low-sedge mires and planted with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)). Soil samples from the topsoil (0-20 cm) were collected 22 years after drainage with two ditch spacings (7.5 and 60 m) and PK-fertilization with three fertilization regimes. Total and available nutrient concentrations were determined. Results indicated that pH and total concentrations of N, P and Ca in the topsoil of extensively drained areas increased with decreasing temperature sum in similar site types. Concentrations of K and Mg were not correlated to temperature sum. Tree height and volume were positively correlated to concentrations of P, K and Ca, but not to N, and only for temperature sums greater than or equal to 950 d.d. (day degrees). Hence, it appeared that P and/or K directly or through their effects on N mineralization, limited tree growth in the south, whereas another growth factor was Limiting in the north. We examined the available/total concentration ratios for the soil nutrients, with the intention to reveal possible climate-dependent trends in those ratios. The available/total ratios of P and Ca were found to increase with increasing temperature sum. For Ca in southern areas the ratios were higher in intensively drained and PR-fertilized plots than in the extensively drained and unfertilized treatment, possibly indicating that peat mineralization had been more intensive. The Ca-ratios for the two northernmost areas, which showed little or no tree growth reaction, did not increase even in the intensively drained and fertilized treatments. We hypothesise that the treatment-induced changes in available/total Ca ratio along the climate gradient also reflect post-drainage intensity of N-mineralization. Hence, the absence of increased Ca-ratios at temperature sums below 950 d.d. may indirectly indicate that tree growth is limited by the microbial release of organically bound N.","2000-02-10","2025-01-08 20:47:12","2025-03-07 18:21:14","","149-161","","2","126","","For.

Scaling-up localized research to inform the Canada-wide boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) recovery strategy epitomizes the challenge. Current policy draws heavily from data obtained at the southern front of range retraction. Here, disturbances benefiting early successional herbivores (e.g., moose [Alces alces]), and hence wolves (Canis lupus) imparts increased predation risk to caribou (via ""disturbance-mediated apparent competition"" [DMAC]). Anthropogenic linear features (e.g., corridors, roads etc.; LFs) also improve wolf hunting efficiency, exacerbating DMAC, with caribou thereby losing functional habitat. However, similar to 2/3 of extant caribou range occurs in northern Canadian Shield and Taiga habitat, which contrasts with southern areas in both disturbance regime (fire-dominated) and community assembly (e.g., no deer [Odocoileus spp.]). To test predictions of DMAC and LF-avoidance in a northern caribou population (Saskatchewan Boreal Shield; similar to 3% of habitat within 500 m of anthropogenic disturbance), we tracked 94 GPS-collared females (2014-2018). Unexpectedly, caribou did not avoid LFs at most scales of observation. Although they responded to vegetation in line with apparent competition, resiliency of conifer-dominated successional trajectories and muted moose-wolf responses to disturbance suggest that poor primary productivity may modulate the strength of DMAC to caribou-including its potential interaction with LFs to influence movements. Before focusing on DMAC as the principal threat to caribou in northern ecoregions, further studies investigating if caribou and predators functionally respond to increasing LF-availability are needed, as it may be most critical for conserving crucial source populations.","2022-01","2025-01-08 20:47:12","2025-03-12 01:49:52","","","","","265","","Biol.

These peatlands are threatened by disturbance from large-scale resource extraction and projected climate change, both of which have the potential to compromise their ecohydrological function. Field measurements and numerical modeling were used to investigate the hydrological responses of peatlands and downgradient streamflow as a consequence of disturbance from mining and shifts in climate, individually and in combination. Mine dewatering reduced groundwater storage by as much as 150 mm, equivalent to a water table lowering of 75 cm, thereby decreasing annual streamflow by 66% in impacted tributaries. Although the projected increases to precipitation and evapotranspiration due to climate change were approximately balanced, resulting in minor changes to storage, there were pronounced shifts in the temporal patterns of streamflow, with a diminished snowmelt and spring freshet occurring a month earlier. When considering the cumulative impacts of climate change coupled with mining, a potential shift in peatland ecohydrology toward new equilibria is plausible, implying altered water movement across the landscape and compromised ecosystem function. This study emphasizes the critical need for further monitoring and modeling efforts to characterize the thresholds and mechanisms driving these ecohydrological changes. This research will guide future investigations on the implications of disturbance on local and regional hydrologic connectivity and facilitate the protection of peatland ecosystems in the HBL and other northern peatland-dominated landscapes.","2024-12","2025-01-08 20:47:12","2025-03-12 01:56:28","","","","12","60","","Water Resour.

We believe that in areas where historical deposition of metals and sulphur was severe, these episodic pulses of metals could reach concentrations sufficiently high to severely affect aquatic communities in receiving waters and cause a delay in biological recovery. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of drought on the chemistry of water draining from two Sudbury peatlands with widely contrasting peat organic matter content to determine the response of stream water chemistry to drought from peatland types in the region. Stream samples were collected using ISCO (TM) automated water collectors from June to November 2011. Following a period of drought, there was a decline in pH and a large increase in concentrations of sulphate and metal ions (Al, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) in water draining both peatlands, with extreme concentrations occurring over a period of about two weeks. At the site with the higher peat organic matter content there was an increase in metals that have a high affinity to bind to DOC (Al, Cu, and Fe) during the onset of drought. This study demonstrates a dramatic response to drought at two sites that differ in metal and nutrient pool sizes, hydrology, and topography, suggesting the potential for a majority of peatlands in the region to experience this response. Efforts to restore aquatic ecosystems and protect freshwater resources must take into account these processes, as disruptions to biogeochemical cycles are likely to become more prevalent in a changing climate.","2013-12","2025-01-08 20:47:12","2025-03-12 01:55:19","","131-145","","1-3","116","","Biogeochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","2","SC: 0000036","<p>- This paper examines the impact of drought on smelter-deposited metal release into lakes and watercourses in the Sudbury region, Ontario.</p>","","","Canada; Ontario; biogeochemistry; cumulative effects; hydrology; peatland; mineral processing; water quality; pollution; air pollution; water body; metal/metalloid; surface water/runoff; watercourses; sulphur compounds; fertility change/contamination; hydrological alteration; drought","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to clarify the biogeochemical functioning of open-water peatland pools and their influence on carbon budgets at the ecosystem and global scale. Continuously operated automated equipment and monthly manual measurements were used to describe the CO2 and CH4 dynamics in boreal ombrotrophic peatland pools and porewater (Québec, Canada) over the growing seasons 2019 and 2020. The peat porewater stable carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) for both CO2 (median δ13C-CO2: −3.8‰) and CH4 (median δ13C-CH4: −64.30‰) suggested that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the predominant degradation pathway in peat. Open-water pools were supersaturated in CO2 and CH4 and received most of these dissolved carbon greenhouse gases (C-GHG) from peat porewater input. Throughout the growing season, higher CO2 concentrations and fluxes in pools were measured when the water table was low—suggesting a steady release of CO2 from deep peat porewater. Higher CH4 ebullition and diffusion occurred in August when bottom water and peat temperatures were the highest. While this study demonstrates that peatland pools are chimneys of CO2 and CH4 stored in peat, it also shows that the C-GHG concentrations and flux rates in peat pools are comparable to other aquatic systems of the same size. Although peatlands are often considered uniform entities, our study highlights their biogeochemical heterogeneity, which, if considered, substantially influences their net carbon balance with the atmosphere.","2024","2025-01-08 20:47:12","2025-03-07 21:59:24","","e2023GB007909","","4","38","","Global Biogeochem.

To ensure restoration initiatives achieve the desired effects on wildlife communities, it is useful to investigate how animals use landscape features. Understanding the relationships between wildlife use and ecological cues provides specific and measurable targets that can be used to measure restoration success. In western Canada, linear feature networks formed by seismic lines, pipelines and roads have altered the boreal forest landscape and resulted in population declines for woodland caribou. Restoration is aimed at supporting caribou recovery by deterring linear feature use by caribou predators and ungulate competitors. Information on how linear feature characteristics facilitate or deter wildlife use supports restoration initiatives by providing specific targets for restoration. Here, we used wildlife track and sign data to investigate biophysical characteristics related to the use of linear features by canines, bears, deer, elk and moose in caribou ranges of west-central and north-western Alberta and British Columbia. We built generalized linear mixed models consistent with three hypotheses that could explain likely mechanisms for use: (1) ease of movement, (2) risk avoidance and (3) resource availability (prey and forage). Moose, deer, elk and bears were more likely to use linear features with either human or game trails. Bears and canines were less likely to use seismic lines with greater lateral vegetation cover and taller vegetation, respectively. Moose, deer and elk were more likely to use linear features with a greater cover of ungulate forage taxa such as willow, birch, sedges and forbs. These results suggest that restoration focusing on trails, online vegetation structure and online vegetation type should deter predators and ungulate prey species to the overall benefit of caribou. Our study corroborates the findings of other research recommending structural and functional restoration using high-intensity line blocking and vegetative regeneration. We provide specific targets for linear feature restoration to assist in prioritization according to restoration objectives, which translates to a broader goal of linking local-level restoration actions to landscape-level conservation goals. This approach to restoration has implications for any major system experiencing anthropogenic landscape change.","2023-01","2025-01-08 20:47:12","2025-03-07 18:19:53","","","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.9","","SC: 0000006","<p>- This paper examines the biophysical characteristics of linear disturbances through boreal forests in AB.<br/>It provides specific targets for linear disturbance restoration. </p>","","","Canada; species-at-risk; linear disturbance; linear feature; on-site restoration; seismic lines; caribou; caribou, boreal population; moose; predation; timber wolf; mitigation hierarchy; mineral exploration; fauna; mammals; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We quantified total mercury (THg) and MeHg concentrations in lakes and streams along a 1700 km permafrost transect in boreal western Canada to determine the influence of regional permafrost extent compared to local lake and catchment characteristics. In lakes, we assessed sediment microbial communities and modeled potential rates of water column photodemethylation (PD). Regardless of permafrost conditions, peatlands were the primary sources of MeHg across the transect as MeHg concentrations in streams increased with aromatic dissolved organic carbon (DOC), iron, and lower pH. Higher DOC and greater catchment peatland extent were further associated with higher stream %MeHg (MeHg/THg). Peatland lakes were potential MeHg sinks, with lower MeHg concentrations than streams (mean +/- 1SD: 0.19 +/- 0.23 and 0.47 +/- 0.77 ng MeHg L-1, respectively), and larger stream catchments had lower %MeHg where PD may occur in abundant small lakes. Microbial communities in lake sediments showed that abundance of Hg reducing genes (merA) predominated over Hg methylating (hgcA) and MeHg demethylating (merB) genes. The effects of permafrost extent on MeHg processes in lakes were secondary to the influence of local catchment characteristics, but lakes in regions with less permafrost had higher DOC concentrations, higher %MeHg, and lower potential rates of PD. Our study highlights a need to understand the impacts of climate change on MeHg source and sink processes, particularly as mediated through changes to peatland DOC, to improve projections of future MeHg concentrations in northern catchments.","2023-03","2025-01-08 20:47:13","2025-02-10 13:48:20","","583-597","","3","68","","Limnol.

The peatland catchment had higher DOC and dissolved MeHg, but lower total Hg concentrations (mean +/- standard deviation; 19 +/- 2.6 mg DOC L-1; 0.08 +/- 0.04 ng DMeHg L-1; 1.1 +/- 0.3 ng THg L-1) than the mixed catchment (12 +/- 4.4 mg DOC L-1; 0.05 +/- 0.01 ng DMeHg L-1; 3.1 +/- 2.2 ng THg L-1). Analyte concentrations increased with discharge at the mixed catchment, suggesting transport limitation and the flushing of near-surface, organic-rich flow paths during wet periods. In contrast, analyte concentrations in the peatland catchment were not primarily associated with discharge. MeHg concentrations, MeHg:THg, and MeHg:DOC increased with water temperature, suggesting enhanced Hg methylation during warmer periods. Mean open water season DOC and total MeHg yields were greater and more variable from the peatland than the mixed catchment (1.1-6.6 vs. 1.4-2.4 g DOC m(-2); 5.2-36 vs. 6.1-10 ng MeHg m(-2)).

Competition from non-native forbs (11% average cover, mainly Sonchus arvensis and Melilotus alba) did not seem to impact the development of the native vegetation community on either soil type given the high cover and richness of native forbs. However, native graminoids (predominantly Calamagrostis canadensis) were associated with reduced native forb cover and richness at graminoid cover greater than 17%. Overall, non-native forbs appeared to have little impact on the native forb community on either soil type while native graminoids had a negative influence. We suggest that the classification of what is considered an undesirable weedy species should be evaluated in the context of ecosystem management goals rather than simply the presence of non-native species.","2021","2025-01-08 20:47:13","2025-03-07 22:07:55","","76","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the colonization of upland reclamation sites on peat-mineral soil mixes by non-native invasive species. &nbsp;Although this paper does not deal with peatlands directly, it presents data on boreal reclamation which would be useful to consider the colonization of peatlands by non-native species.</p> </div>","","","Canada; on-site restoration; upland; vegetation; peat; mine reclamation; invasive species; mitigation hierarchy; substrate; mine planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper used peat properties (degree of humification, peat type, ash content, porosity, moisture content, bulk density, and shear strength) and novel erosion threshold measurements from intact soil cores to explain peat erodibility and spatial variations in SS concentrations (SSCs) and SS loads (SSLs) at 20 Finnish peat extraction sites. The erosion threshold measurements suggested that critical shear stresses for particle entrainment decrease with increasing degree of humification (von Post scale) and are significantly lower in well-decomposed peat than in slightly or moderately decomposed peat. Two critical shear stresses were obtained from moderately decomposed peat samples, indicating a degree of surface armoring by coarse peat fibers. Monitored long-term average SSC was highest at study sites with well-decomposed peat, while very fine-grained mineral subsoil explained some of the highest long-term SSC in areas where drainage ditches penetrated below the upper peat layer. Average SSL (kg d(-1)) at the study sites was best explained (R-2=0.89) by average discharge and surface peat decomposition level.

Less information exists about the effects of different concentrations and sources of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> loading on MeHg production in remote, non- SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> impacted regions like Canada’s north, where increased SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> loadings come not from the atmosphere, but often from mining waste water and rock tailings. A three year field study (two years of loading; one year of recovery) examined the effects of simulated wastewater (containing 27.2 mg/L SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) on MeHg production. Methylmercury concentrations increased to concentrations > 4.0 ng/L (background average = 0.09 ng/L) by the end of each field season but during the recovery year decreased to < 0.80 ng/L - still above background. Changes in partitioning between pore waters and peat were observed in the experimental fen, suggesting that the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> additions significantly impacted MeHg production in pore waters, and down-gradient movement. To evaluate different SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> loadings and sources, laboratory column experiments were conducted at a range of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations in solution, as well as using mine tailings rock that leached SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>.

Recent concerns about the ecohydrological impacts to these large northern peatlands resulting from climate change and resource extraction have catalyzed a resurgence in scientific research into this ecologically important region. However, the sheer size, heterogeneity and elaborate landscape arrangements of this ecosystem raise important questions concerning representative sampling of environmental media for chemical or physical characterization. To begin to quantify such variability, this study assessed the small-scale spatial (1m) and short temporal (21day) variability of surface pore-water biogeochemistry (pH, dissolved organic carbon, and major ions) in a <i>Sphagnum</i> spp.-dominated, ombrotrophic raised bog, and a <i>Carex </i>spp.-dominated intermediate fen in the HBL. In general, pore-water pH and concentrations of dissolved solutes were similar to previously reported literature values from this region. However, systematic sampling revealed consistent statistically significant differences in pore-water chemistries between the bog and fen peatland types, and large within-site spatiotemporal variability. We found that microtopography in the bog was associated with consistent differences in most biogeochemical variables. Temporal changes in dissolved solute chemistry, particularly base cations (Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>), were statistically significant in the intermediate fen, likely a result of a dynamic connection between surficial waters and mineral-rich deep groundwater. In both the bog and fen, concentrations of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> showed considerable spatial variability, and a significant decrease in concentrations over the study period. The observed variability in peatland pore-water biogeochemistry over such small spatial and temporal scales suggests that under-sampling in northern peatland environments could lead to erroneous conclusions concerning the abundance and distribution of natural elements and pollutants alike.","2013-06-01","2025-01-08 20:47:13","2025-03-07 18:21:41","","211-218","","","454-455","","Sci.

Conventional clearing techniques for seismic assessment have left a legacy of linear disturbances that cause habitat fragmentation. Little is known, however, about how local and landscape factors affect natural regeneration patterns of trees and shrubs on seismic lines that facilitate mapping and future projections of regeneration patterns. To understand factors affecting early forest regeneration and to predict future trends in regeneration of legacy seismic lines we used LiDAR, forest stand databases and a disturbance inventory of conventional seismic lines to model seismic line regeneration to a 3 m height in a 1806 km(2) area in northeastern Alberta, Canada. Regeneration to 3 m was inversely related to terrain wetness, line width, proximity to roads (as a proxy for human use of lines), and the lowland ecosites. Overall, terrain wetness and the presence of fen ecosites had the strongest negative effect on regeneration patterns; the wettest sites failed to recover even after 50 years post-disturbance. Predictions of future regeneration rates on existing lines suggested that approximately one-third of existing linear disturbance footprints in this boreal landscape will remain un-regenerated 50 years later resulting in persistent habitat fragmentation. Model predictions estimating regeneration probability are particularly valuable for estimating current and future forest regeneration trajectories on linear disturbances which are a conservation concern and a focus for restoration and planning by government, industry and conservation organizations.","2015-04","2025-01-08 20:47:14","2025-03-12 01:48:50","","127-135","","","184","","Biol.

Some natural regeneration of Sphagnum has occurred in isolated pockets on traditionally harvested (block-cut) sites, for reasons that are poorly understood, but are related to natural functions that regulate runoff and evaporation. This study evaluates the water balance of a naturally regenerated cutover bog and compares it with a nearby natural bog of similar size and origin, near Riviere du Loup, Quebec. Water balance results indicated that evapotranspiration was the major water loss from the harvested bog, comprising 92 and 84% of total outputs (2·9 mm day−1) during the 1997 and 1998 seasons, respectively. Despite denser tree cover at the harvested site, evapotranspiration from the natural bog was similar, although less spatially variable. At the harvested site, evaporative losses ranged from 1·9 mm day−1 on raised baulks and roads to 3·6 mm day−1 from moist surfaces with Sphagnum. Although about half of the ditches were inactive or operating at only a fraction of their original efficiency, runoff was still significant at 12 and 24% of precipitation during the 1997 and 1998 study seasons, respectively. This compares with negligible rates of runoff at the natural bog. Thus the cutover bog, although abandoned over 25 years ago, has not regained its hydrological function. This is both a cause and effect of its inability to support renewed Sphagnum regeneration. Without suitable management (e.g. blocking ditches), this site is not likely to improve for a very long time.

This paper presents a conceptual model of bog disturbance caused by peat harvesting (1942–1972), and the hydrological evolution that occurred after abandonment (1973–1998). Two adjacent bogs of similar size and origin, one harvested and the other essentially undisturbed, provide the basis for understanding what changes occurred. The model is based on historical trends evident from previous surveys of land-use, bog ecology and resource mapping; and from recent hydrological and ecological data that characterize the current condition. Water balance data and historical information suggest that runoff increased and evapotranspiration decreased following drainage, but tended towards pre-disturbance levels following abandonment, as vegetation recolonized the surface and drainage became less efficient over time. Dewatering of soil pores after drainage caused shrinkage and oxidation of the peat and surface subsidence of approximately 80 cm over 57 years. Comparisons with a nearby natural bog suggest that bulk density in the upper 50 cm of cutover peat increased from 0·07 to 0·13 g cm−3, specific yield declined from 0·14 to 0·07, water table fluctuations were 67% greater, and mean saturated hydraulic conductivity declined from 4·1 × 10−5 to 1·3 × 10−5 cm s−1. More than 25 years after abandonment, Sphagnum mosses were distributed over broad areas but covered less than 15% of the surface. Areas with ‘good’ Sphagnum regeneration (>10% cover) were strongly correlated with high water tables (mean −22 cm), especially in zones of seasonal groundwater discharge, artefacts of the extraction history. Forest cover expanded from 5 to 20% of the study area following abandonment. The effect of forest growth (transpiration and interception) and drainage on lowering water levels eventually will be countered by slower water movement through the increasingly dense soil, and by natural ditch deterioration. However, without management intervention, full re-establishment of natural hydrological functions will take a very long time.

Both prerequisites are required for using peatlands as archives of atmospheric Tl deposition and Tl isotopic ratios as a source proxy. We demonstrate that Tl is an immobile element in peat with a conservative pattern synonymous to that of Pb, and in contrast to Zn. However, the peat Tl record was more affected by geogenic source(s), as inferred from the calculated element enrichments. The finding further implies that Tl was largely absent from the pre-industrial emissions (>~250 years BP). The measured variations in Tl isotopic ratios in respective peat samples suggest a consistency with anthropogenic Tl (Ε205Tl between ~ -3 and − 4), as well as with background Tl isotopic values in the study area (Ε205Tl between ~0 and − 1), in line with detected 206Pb/207Pb ratios (1.16–1.19). Therefore, we propose that peatlands can be used for monitoring trends in Tl deposition and that Tl isotopic ratios can serve to distinguish its origin(s).

In polluted areas of the UK, high atmospheric N deposition (as a component of acid deposition) has been considered among the causes of Sphagnum decline in bogs (ombrogenous peatlands). In relatively unpolluted areas of western Canada and northern Sweden, short-term experimental studies have shown that Sphagnum responds quickly to nutrient loading, with uptake and retention of nitrogen and increased production. Here we examine the response of Sphagnum fuscum to enhanced nitrogen deposition generated during 34 years of oil sands mining through the determination of net primary production (NPP) and nitrogen concentrations in the upper peat column. We chose six continental bogs receiving differing atmospheric nitrogen loads (modeled using a CALPUFF 2D dispersion model). Sphagnum fuscum net primary production (NPP) at the high deposition site (Steepbank-mean of 600 g/m2; median of 486 g/m2) was over three times as high than at five other sites with lower N deposition. Additionally, production of S. fuscum may be influenced to some extent by distance of the moss surface from the water table. Across all sites, peat nitrogen concentrations are highest at the surface, decreasing in the top 3 cm with no significant change with increasing depth. We conclude that elevated N deposition at the Steepbank site has enhanced Sphagnum production. Increased N concentrations are evident only in the top 1-cm of the peat profile. Thus, 34 years after mine startup, increased N-deposition has increased net primary production of Sphagnum fuscum without causing elevated levels of nitrogen in the organic matter profile. A response to N-stress for Sphagnum fuscum is proposed at 14-34 kg ha-1 yr-1. A review of N-deposition values reveals a critical N-deposition value of between 14.8 and 15.7 kg ha-1 yr-1 for NPP of Sphagnum species.]","2003","2025-01-08 20:47:14","2025-03-07 22:06:58","","235-245","","2","106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0.9","4","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the impacts of elevated atmospheric nitrogen deposition in peatlands of northern Alberta relative to their distance to oil sands extraction operations and reports increases in productivity as a result of N enrichment. <br></p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; vegetation; mining; nutrients; pollution; air pollution; bryophytes; sphagnum; nutrient enrichment; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These wetlands comprise more than half of the landscape, and their distribution and local hydrology are the result of interactions among a subhumid climate, topography, and spatially heterogeneous surficial and bedrock geology. Since hydrology plays a fundamental role in wetland ecological functioning and determines wetland sensitivity to human disturbances, the characterization of anthropogenic impacts on wetland hydrology in the AOSR is necessary to assess wetland resilience and to improve current best management practices. As such, this paper reviews the impacts of oil sands development and related disturbances including infrastructure construction, gravel extraction, and land clearing on wetland function in the AOSR. Hydrologic disturbances in wetlands in the AOSR include changes to soil hydrophysical properties that control water table position, the interruption of recharge–discharge patterns, and alteration of micrometeorological conditions; these in turn govern wetland ecological structure and wetland ecosystem processes (e.g., evapotranspiration, nutrient cycling).

One of the key indicators of reclamation success is the accumulation of organic matter within constructed fens. Thus, a better understanding of the linkages between salt content and organic matter storage in saline boreal fens can be useful for advancing fen construction in this region. As such, this study investigates how salinity fluctuations estimated by diatom-based transfer functions, coupled with changes in hydrological conditions and vegetation inferred from macrofossils have influenced organic matter accumulation rates (OMAR) over the last approximately 100 years in open-water areas (ponds) within a saline boreal fen near Fort McMurray, Alberta. Median OMAR (181 g m (super -2) yr (super -1) ) of the site suggests that the ponds situated within saline boreal fens can accumulate organic matter at a rate comparable to freshwater boreal and subarctic ponds, and the estimated salinity levels (3-21 ppt) did not severely affect organic matter accumulation. Strong significant positive (Lager Pond), strong significant negative (South Pond), and weak insignificant (Pilsner Pond) correlations between OMAR and diatom-inferred salinity were observed, suggesting that relations between organic matter accumulation and salt content are not straightforward, and salinity was not the main control on OMAR. Macrofossil data showed that organic matter accumulation has been mainly driven by water level, type of primary producers and pond regime. OMAR was the highest during the transition from peatland to ponds due to low decomposition rates resulting from high inputs of relatively resistant plant litter, and anoxic conditions. A macrophyte-dominated pond regime was associated with higher OMAR relative to algae-dominated regime.","2018","2025-01-08 20:47:14","2025-03-12 01:48:50","","425-433","","","165","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SC: 0000012","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the accumulation of organic matter in open water areas of a saline fen wetland in he Alberta oil sands region.

Contemporary, intermediate, and long-term rates of peat oxidation were measured in an abandoned cutover peatland to estimate the mass of lost in order to determine if the oxidation rate has changed with time since abandonment. Contemporary rates were measured six times per week at 25 locations within the peatland using a portable infrared gas analyser and an enclosure system. Mean daily peat oxidation was 7.7 g CO2 m-2 d-1 or 4.8 mm yr-1. Intermediate (2-13 yr) oxidation rates were estimated using dendrochronological techniques. Over 325 birch (Betula spp.) shrubs, an invasive group of species in abandoned cutover peatlands, were removed from the peatland after measuring the distance to the existing peat surface from the collar of the trunk. Dating the birches permitted the determination of the rate of peat oxidation and erosion since the establishment of individuals. Long-term oxidation (19 yr) was estimated with over 10 000 measurements on exposed stable tree stumps. The mean intermediate and long-term oxidation rates were 6.2 ± 2.9 mm yr-1 and 5.7 ± 1.1 mm yr-1, respectively. These results suggest that peat oxidation rates remain high even after two decades of post-extraction abandonment. Since oxidation is an irreversible process, these results carry important implications for restoration work as well as for the determination of the long-term source of atmospheric CO2.

Here, we provide the first detailed synthesis of autogenic hydrological feedbacks that operate within northern peatlands to regulate their response to changes in seasonal water deficit and varying disturbances. We review, synthesize and critique the current process-based understanding and qualitatively assess the relative strengths of these feedbacks for different peatland types within different climate regions. We suggest that understanding the role of hydrological feedbacks in regulating changes in precipitation and temperature are essential for understanding the resistance, resilience and vulnerability of northern peatlands to a changing climate.

However, understanding the symbiotic processes governing water and gas exchange is essential to the development of appropriate management plans for peatland restoration. In this paper, we highlight and contrast the suite of processes governing the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon on natural, harvested, and restored peatlands. Evapotranspiration from harvested sites is important throughout the spring and summer, and is not greatly different from the adjacent natural bog. On cutover peatlands, strong capillary water movement compensates for the lack of vascular plants, which on the natural bog become increasingly important as the capillary water movement within drying Sphagnum decreases. Methane emissions from cutover bogs are an order of magnitude lower than in natural sites, however, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are approximately three times greater. Peatland restoration enhances CO2 sequestration, although restoration (at least in the short term) does not restore the net carbon sink function to that in natural bogs. A conceptual model highlighting these changes in the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon from a natural bog through drainage, harvesting, abandonment, and restoration is presented.

Disturbance for horticultural peat extraction disrupts ecosystem function and converts these ecosystems to large, persistent sources of carbon dioxide (CO2). This study investigates the effect of ecosystem-scale restoration on growing season CO2 exchange in a peatland by comparing a restored site to a neighboring nonrestored section for 1 year prerestoration (1999) and 3 years postrestoration (2000–2002). Prior to restoration, less than 23% of the site was vegetated, and it was a source of 245 g C m<sup>−2</sup> to the atmosphere during the growing season (May to early October). Following restoration, the water table remained deep, and soil moisture was significantly higher than the nonrestored section. By the third year postrestoration, vegetation covered 50% of the restored peatland. Moss covered 90% of this vegetated area. Vegetation productivity at the restored site was also enhanced with gross ecosystem photosynthesis under full light conditions significantly higher at the restored site at both moss and herbaceous plots by 2002. While this increase in vegetation productivity provided fresh substrate and resulted in higher CO2 production potential for restored site peat, ecosystem respiration was similar to or lower than that at the nonrestored site for both bare peat and vegetated areas because of the generally wetter site conditions resulting from restoration. By upscaling chamber CO<sub>2</sub> exchange measurements to the ecosystem level, on the basis of the relative proportion of each surface cover type, we determined the site was a net sink of ∼20 ± 5 g C m<sup>−2</sup> during the growing season only 2 years postrestoration. Combining our results with previous work on CH<sub>4</sub> emissions and dissolved organic carbon export, we suggest that this degraded peatland ecosystem will likely return to a net carbon sink in 6 to 10 years postrestoration.","2010","2025-01-08 20:47:15","2025-03-07 18:19:57","","","","G1","115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SC: 0000379","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the carbon and greenhouse gas dynamics of a peatland restored using the moss layer transfer technique relative to pre-restoration conditions. &nbsp;The study demonstrates that the peatland is returning toward a carbon sink.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; greenhouse gases; substrate disturbance; carbon sequestration; monitoring; carbon cycle; bryophytes; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sixty four sites were measured, including oil sands mining facilities, quarry operations, and roadways in the vicinity of Ft. McMurray and Ft. McKay. Key parameters related to windblown dust generation were characterized including: threshold friction velocity, reservoir type, and particle size-segregated emission potential. The threshold wind speed for particle suspension varies from 11 to 21.5 km/h (u (sub 10) (super +) ; measured at 10 m above ground level), and saltation occurs at higher speeds of u (sub 10) (super +) >32 km/h. All surfaces have limited dust supplies at lower wind speeds of <27 km/h, but have unlimited dust supplies at the highest wind speed tested (56 km/h). Unpaved roads, parking lots, or bare land with high abundances of loose clay and silt materials along with frequent mechanical disturbances are the highest dust emitting surfaces. Paved roads, stabilized or treated (e.g., watered) surfaces with limited loose dust materials are the lowest emitting surfaces. Surface watering proved effective in reducing dust emissions, with potential emission reductions of 50-99%. Surface disturbances by traffic or other activities were found to increase PM (sub 10) emission potentials 9-160 times. These data will improve the accuracy of emission inventories, dust dispersion, transport, and source apportionment models, and help design and evaluate dust control strategies.","2015","2025-01-08 20:47:15","2025-02-25 14:17:03","","121-134","","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents the wind erosion and fugitive dust potential from disturbed land and tailings in the Alberta oil sands. &nbsp;It tests mitigation measures to avoid or minimize the release of fugitive dust.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; linear disturbance; mining; substrate disturbance; contaminant transport; pollution; air pollution; erosion; impact avoidance; impact minimization; fugitive dust; roads; wind erosion; mitigation hierarchy; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we compare snowpack chemistry to high-frequency measurements of river water quality across six watersheds (five impacted by oil sands development and one unimpacted). Catchment scale snowpack Hg and MeHg loads normalized to watershed area were highest near oil sands operations. River water Hg concentrations and loads tracked discharge and tended to be higher downstream of mining operations, while MeHg concentrations and loads increased through the summer, reflecting peak summer MeHg production rates. Except in the reference watershed, snowpack Hg and MeHg loads equaled or exceeded the amount of Hg and MeHg exported during freshet and, in some cases, the entire hydrologic year. This suggests landscapes across the oil sands region, which are dominated by low-relief wetlands and other shallow-water systems, are accumulating Hg and MeHg. Importantly, during years of high discharge, these low-relief systems appear to become better connected and flush MeHg (and Hg) from the watershed.

Wolf predation and resource selection so heavily targeted deer (<i>Odocoileus virginiana </i>or <i>O hemionus</i>) that wolves appeared drawn away from prime caribou habitat.

To evaluate whether the release of metals into soil solution in peatlands is predictable using simple, widely available soil parameters, six peatlands, with varying levels of metal contamination, including a previously limed peatland, were sampled around the Sudbury, Ontario, region, and were subjected to simulated drought. The simulated drought lowered soil water pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, which is consistent with field observations. Metal partitioning (K-d) values for Co, Mn, Ni, and Zn, with just one exception at one peatland, could be significantly predicted by just the pH of the soil water, although the strength of the relationship varied considerably among sites. The metal speciation model WHAM VII predicted that the free metal ion concentration of all metals tested, including Cu and Al, increased significantly with decreasing pH. At the same time, DOC-bound metal concentrations were predicted to decrease as DOC levels were lower, which for metals with strong organic matter affinities (Cu and Al) offset the increase in free metal ion concentration in soil solution following summer drought. Climate change forecasts for more frequent and sustained droughts may promote metal release from peatlands and increased mobilization to surface waters, and importantly, for some metals, the potential toxicity of the metals released from peatlands may increase to a greater extent than expected from increases in total metal concentrations because of decreased DOC following drought.","2015-04","2025-01-08 20:47:16","2025-03-12 01:55:17","","","","4","226","","Water Air Soil Pollut","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.9","4","SC: 0000021","<p>- This paper examines the effect of simulated drought on smelter-derived metal release from peats in peatlands in Sudbury, Ontario.</p>","","","Canada; Ontario; cumulative effects; peatland; mining; peat; mineral processing; drawdown; pollution; air pollution; metal/metalloid; substrate; fertility change/contamination; hydrological alteration; drought","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forest management activities, pulp and paper operations, electric power generation, mining, conventional oil and gas extraction, nonconventional oil sand development, and peat mining occur throughout the boreal zone with varying impacts on water resources. We review impacts of these industries on surface water, groundwater, and wetlands recognizing that heterogeneity in the dominance of different hydrologic processes (i.e., precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and runoff generation) across the boreal zone influences the degree of impacts on water resources. Through the application of best management practices, forest certification programs, and science-based guidelines, timber, pulp and paper, and peat industries have reduced their impacts on water resources, although uncertainties remain about long-term recovery following disturbance. Hydroelectric power developments have moved toward reducing reservoir size and creating more natural flow regimes, although impacts of aging infrastructure and dam decommissioning is largely unknown. Mineral and metal mining industries have improved regulation and practices, but the legacy of abandoned mines across the boreal zone still presents an ongoing risk to water resources. Oil and gas industries, including non-conventional resources such as oil sands, is one of the largest industrial users of water and, while significant progress has been made in reducing water use, more work is needed to ensure the protection of water resources. All industries contribute to atmospheric deposition of pollutants that may eventually be released to downstream waters. Although most industrial sectors strive to improve their environmental performance with regards to water resources, disruptions to natural flow regimes and risks of degraded water quality exist at local to regional scales in the boreal zone. Addressing the emerging challenge of managing the expanding, intensifying, and cumulative effects of industries in conjunction with other stressors, such as climate change and atmospheric pollution, across the landscape will aid in preserving Canadas rich endowment of water resources. © 2015 Published by NRC Research Press.","2015","2025-01-08 20:47:16","2025-03-07 18:21:41","","78-131","","1","23","","Environ.

Changes in peatland plant community composition in response to climate change may alter nutrient availability, energy budgets, trace gas fluxes, and carbon storage. We investigated plant community response to warming and drying in a field mesocosm experiment in northern Minnesota, USA. Large intact soil monoliths removed from a bog and a fen received three infrared warming treatments crossed with three water-table treatments (n = 3) for five years. Foliar cover of each species was estimated annually. In the bog, increases in soil temperature and decreases in water-table elevation increased cover of shrubs by 50% and decreased cover of graminoids by 50%. The response of shrubs to warming was distinctly species-specific, and ranged from increases (for <i>Andromeda glaucophylla</i> ) to decreases (for Kalmia polifolia ). In the fens, changes in plant cover were driven primarily by changes in water-table elevation, and responses were species- and lifeform-specific: increases in water-table elevation increased cover of graminoids - in particular Carex lasiocarpa and Carex livida - as well as mosses. In contrast, decreases in water-table elevation increased cover of shrubs, in particular A. glaucophylla and Chamaedaphne calyculata . The differential and sometimes opposite response of species and lifeforms to the treatments suggest that the structure and function of both bog and fen plant communities will change - in different directions or at different magnitudes - in response to warming and/or changes in water-table elevation that may accompany regional or global climate change.","2003-02","2025-01-08 20:47:16","2025-03-07 21:59:21","","141-151","","2","9","","Global Change Biol.","","","","","","","","","","","","","11.6","1","","<p>- This paper uses a soil monolith study to study the effects of drainage and soil drying on plant cover and composition.</p>","","","climate change; hydrology; peatland; vegetation; bog; soil warming; substrate disturbance; water table; drawdown; fen; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The response of soil water content, temperature, and carbon gas concentrations to increased nutrient loading is poorly known and we thus determined these data at the long-term N fertilization site Mer Bleue bog, Ontario, during a two month period in summer. Soil temperatures decreased with NPK addition in shallow peat soil primarily during the daytime (t-test, p<0.05) owing to increased shading, whereas they increased in deeper peat soil (t-test, p<0.05), probably by enhanced thermal conductivity. These effects were confirmed by (sub RM) ANOVA, which also suggested an influence of volumetric water contents as co-variable on soil temperature and vice versa (p<0.05). Averaged over all fertilized treatments, the mean soil temperatures at 5 cm depth decreased by 1.3 degrees C and by 4.7 degrees C (standard deviation 0.9 degrees C) at noon. Water content was most strongly affected by within-plot spatial heterogeneity but also responded to both N and PK load according to (sub RM) ANOVA (p<0.05). Overall, water content and CO (sub 2) concentrations in the near-surface peat (t-test, p<0.05) were lower with increasing N load, suggesting more rapid soil gas exchange.

The Panel met five times between January and May 2018. Despite the relatively short timelines, consensus was achieved on more than 30 recommendations for the development of a wetland offsetting policy for Ontario. Key among these was an emphasis on prevention: that offsetting should only be considered when the requirements for avoidance, minimization and mitigation have been met. Given that approvals for activities that result in wetland impacts fall under a variety of statutes, regulations and policies, the Panel feels strongly that the mitigation sequence, including the offsetting policy should be embedded across a wider range of legislation, regulations, and policy. This would broaden the application of, and adherence to the mitigation sequence and ensure the ability to impose meaningful restrictions and sanctions. The Panel explored many aspects of and possible models for offsetting, but the limited time available did not allow for the development of detailed conclusions about a complete program design. The recommendations acknowledge the need for the development of detailed technical guidance on specific elements of implementation, including roles and responsibilities, wetland evaluation, offset ratios, and the size and location of offsets. Consistent with A Wetland Conservation Strategy for Ontario, the Panel acknowledges that there are limitsto offsetting: that some wetlands should not be eligible for offsets because of their vulnerability and/or irreplaceability. The policy and any associated regulations should clearly articulate these limits and be supported by technical guidance for implementation. Finally, a variety of offsetting mechanisms are in use in Canada and elsewhere in the world, each offering both challenges and opportunities that were considered in making recommendations with respect to offsetting in Ontario.","2018","2025-01-08 20:47:16","2025-03-07 22:08:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This report provides recommendations for policy for offsetting wetland loss in Ontario. &nbsp;It states that fens and bogs should be ineligible for offsetting because of their irreplaceability.</p> </div>","","","Ontario; provincial policy/statute; monitoring; offsetting; policy discussion paper; wetland policy; mitigation hierarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many topographical factors that control snow accumulation and melt (e.g. slope, aspect) are not relevant in the James Bay Lowlands because of the extremely low relief. Thus, vegetation characteristics (e.g. winter leaf area index, tree density), which are strongly linked to peatland type, may dictate spatial patterns of snow accumulation and melt across the landscape. A 1.5-km long transect that bisected five peatland types representative of the local area was used to determine average snow depth, density and water equivalence for each of the landscape units. The peatland types were classified, in part, because of the density of treed vegetation and were named open bog, open shrub fen, low-density treed fen, medium density treed bog and high-density treed fen. Those with medium or high-density treed vegetation accumulated significantly more snow than those with low or open densities. Snow density, however, showed no correlation with landscape unit, and snowmelt proceeded at similar rates between all landscape units because of the relatively open canopy typical of this environment. A randomization test showed that the areally weighted basin average snow depth estimates varied by less than 10 cm as a result of the small but statistically significant differences in snow accumulation among landscape units. These differences are therefore relatively unimportant for accurately quantifying basin-wide snow depth in this landscape.","2012-08-15","2025-01-08 20:47:16","2025-03-07 18:21:41","","2663-2671","","17","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.2","3","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the snowpack in peatlands in the Hudson Bay Lowland across peatland types.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; hydrology; peatland; vegetation; bog; fen; landform; spring thaw; Hudson Bay Lowland; snowpack; physiography; climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dewatering of an open-pit diamond mine in the area has depressurized the regional bedrock aquifer. Bioherms, fractured limestone outcroppings formed from ancient coral reefs that protrude to the peatland surface, lack this mantle of low-permeability sediments and provide a direct connection between the peatland (surficial) and the regional (bedrock) aquifers. Well transects and piezometer nests were installed around seven bioherms in the depressurized zone and one in a non-affected zone (control) to monitor the water table drawdown and change in hydraulic gradients around the bioherms. Water tables in the affected bioherms decreased between 2 and 4 m in the first 4 years of dewatering. The drawdown in the bioherms caused a localized water table drawdown in the peat surrounding the bioherms that extended to approximately 30 m from the edge of the bioherm during a dry period. Under wet conditions, drawdown was similar to that at the control site. Hydraulic gradients in the peat (which typically are very small) increased over the field seasons and in a few locations exceeded 1. These gradients represented significant losses to the local, near bioherm, system as at many of the locations surrounding the bioherms vertical seepage losses ranged between 1 and 4 mm/day, which are similar to the seasonal average evaporative water loss of ~ 3 mm/day.

Dewatering of an open-pit diamond mine is depressurizing the surrounding Silurian bedrock below the MS. Prior to mining, it was assumed that these MS would largely isolate the overlying peatlands from the depressurized regional bedrock aquifer. To assess this isolation, we instrumented a 1.5 km long transect of wells and piezometers located within the zone of the mine's influence that crossed a sequence of bogs, fens, and bedrock outcrops (bioherms). Results were differentiated between those areas with no MS (near bioherms) and those underlain by MS (non-bioherm) along the transect. Between 2007 and 2010 at near-bioherm and non-bioherm locations, average peat water tables declined 71 and 31 cm, and hydraulic head declined 66 and 32 cm, in bioherm and non-bioherm locations, respectively. Gradients varied from near zero (-0.001) at the start of dewatering to -0.03 (after 5 years) in non-bioherm areas and from -0.20 to -0.45 in near-bioherm areas. These gradients corresponded to fluxes (groundwater recharge) of approximately -0.26 mm/day and -2.1 mm/day, in non- and near-bioherm areas, respectively. Specific discharge (recharge) determined using the known mine dewatering rate and drawdown cone heads and areas corresponded well with measured recharge determined in the non-bioherm transect locations. A simple rearrangement of Darcy's Law used to calculate the specific discharge highlighted how the ratio of hydraulic conductivity to the thickness of the MS can be used to assess vulnerable areas. Therefore, given the increasing development in Ontario's Far North, considerable attention must be given to both the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of MS.","2013","2025-01-08 20:47:16","2025-03-07 18:21:41","","1845-1853","","13","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.2","3","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of mine dewatering for an open pit mine in the Hudson Bay Lowland and the role of fine marine sediments to minimize the impacts of mine dewatering. </p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; hydrology; peatland; mining; groundwater; water table; drawdown; landform; Hudson Bay Lowland; physiography; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2002, the water table in a fen peatland near Quebec City was lowered by ∼20 cm (Experimental site), and hydrological response was measured compared to Control (no manipulation) and Drained (previously drained c. 1994) sites. Because of the draw-down, the surface in the Experimental pool decreased 5, 15 and 20 cm in the ridge, lawn and mat, respectively, increasing bulk density by ∼60% in the Experimental lawn. Hydraulic conductivity (K) generally decreased with depth and from Control (25–125 cm) 10−1 to 10−5 cm s−1 to Experimental (25–125 cm) 10−2 to 10−7 cm s−1 and to Drained (25–75 cm) 10−2 to 10−6 cm s−1. In similar topographic locations (ridge, lawn, mat), K trended Control > Experimental > Drained, usually by an order of magnitude at similar depths in similar topographic locations. Water table fluctuations in the Drained site averaged twice those of the Control site. The water table in the Control lawn remained at a stable depth relative to the surface (∼− 1 cm) because the lawn peat floats with changes in water table position. However, the Drained lawn peat was more rigid because of the denser degraded peat, forcing the water to fluctuate relative to the surface and further enhancing peat decay and densification. This provides a positive feedback loop that could intensify further peat degradation, changing the carbon cycling dynamics.

To assess the potential effects of particulate fugitive dust from oil sands development in Alberta, Canada, we quantified plant/lichen tissue Ca, Mg, K, and P concentrations in 6 bogs ranging from 12 to 77 km from the oil sands industrial center. Deposition of Ca and Mg, but not K or P, quantified using ion exchange resin collectors, to bogs decreased with distance from the oil sands industrial center.

Tissue concentrations of K and P were not correlated with growing season K and P deposition. For each species, receptor modeling identified two distinct sources, one dominated by Ca and Mg, presumed to represent particulate fugitive dust from oil sands activities, and a second dominated by K and P, which may reflect tight internal cycling and upward translocation of K and P in peat and/or K and P deposition as particulates generated in wildfires.

Continued resource exploration in this environment has created a need to better understand the processes causing permafrost thaw and concomitant changes to the terrain and ground cover, in order to efficiently reduce the environmental impact of future exploration through the development of best management practices. In a peatland 50 km south of Fort Simpson, NWT, permafrost thaw and the resulting ground surface subsidence have produced water-logged linear disturbances that appear not to be regenerating permafrost, and in many cases have altered the land cover type to resemble that of a wetland bog or fen. Subsidence alters the hydrology of plateaus, developing a fill and spill drainage pattern that allows some disturbances to be hydrologically connected with adjacent wetlands via surface flow paths during periods of high water availability. The degree of initial disturbance is an important control on the extent of permafrost thaw and thus the overall potential recovery of the linear disturbance. Low impact techniques that minimize ground surface disturbance and maintain original surface topography by eliminating windrows are needed to minimize the impact of these linear disturbances.

Peatlands store organic materials, regulate nutrient turnover and act as a carbon sink for global climate change, yet relatively little is known in regards to the impact of the mining legacy of this region and the potential microbial communities affected. Eleven peatland sites (poor to intermediate fens) around Sudbury were chosen in order to study the microbial diversity and function that control decomposition and nutrient cycling. The analysis of microbial communities was accomplished via high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in bacteria and archaea on the Illumina MiSeq platform, while the analysis of microbial function was conducted through the Sinsabaugh enzyme protocol and gas chromatography of in situ greenhouse gases. There was a difference across the site gradient with microbial diversity, community structure, and microbially mediated gas efflux differing between areas closest to current and historical smelters to areas 55-km away. There was also a difference within each peatland where vertical profiles in microbial enzyme function varied over four depths, with the surface depth having the highest enzyme activity. Metal impact and pH are major drivers of microbial diversity and community with pH driving metal availability. This is seen where the sites with the lowest pH having the lowest microbial diversity and unique communities, and sites with the highest pH having the highest microbial diversity and distinct communities. We can also deduce that microbial function differs over depth because of the difference between the aerobic and the anaerobic communities, where the aerobic communities appear to be more active. We can reason that methane efflux was higher in impacted sites because of the increased concentrations of Nickel, Copper, pH and possibly Sulphur creating restrains on microbially mediated gas effluxes through the inhibition of methane production.","2016","2025-01-08 20:47:17","2025-02-10 13:43:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","Laurentian University","Sudbury","","","M.Sc.","","","","","","<p>- This thesis examines the impact of atmospheric deposition of metals on the microbial activity and communities in peatlands along a distance gradient from a Ni-Cu smelter.</p>","","","Canada; Ontario; peatland; greenhouse gases; microbial activity; mineral processing; pollution; carbon cycle; air pollution; fugitive dust; metal/metalloid; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simplification of the surface nanotopography was found on all tracks compared to surrounding control areas, with increased micro-erosion patterns in rutted areas, and invasive species on some treatments. The frequency of previous usage was not found to be a significant factor controlling nano-topographic loss. Edge effects and hillslope position were influential in places, but these effects were not consistent across treatments. Nano-topographic recovery was found to be inhibited when track usage commenced within a short time frame after track construction.

However, there is a lack of understanding about how such networks impact peatland functioning. We found that research trends on peatland access track studies have changed from a concern largely with the physical properties of peat and its suitability as a substrate for building, to study of vegetation recovery, microbiological functioning and carbon cycling processes. Some recent research has examined vehicular access route impacts on peat ecohydrological processes showing that biogeochemical processes are affected, and that vegetation recovery is significantly impeded in post abandonment periods. Sizeable knowledge gaps which could form the focus of future research include the effects of roads on tropical peatlands, influence of plastic, erosion and pipe formation processes, the hydrological effects of seismic trails, ecotoxicological effects of plastic tracks and chemical pollutants on peatlands resulting from vehicular access, the ecohydrological recovery process after temporary roads are removed from peatlands.","2021-03","2025-01-08 20:47:17","2025-11-10 14:35:24","","","","","214","","Earth-Sci.

A chronosequence approach was used to compare vegetation near ditches blocked 5 years, 4 years and 1 year prior to the study with vegetation near unblocked ditches. Plots adjacent to and 3 m away from 70 ditches within an area of blanket bog were assessed for floristic composition, aeration depth using steel bars, and topography using LiDAR data. No changes in aeration depth or vegetation parameters were detected as a function of ditch-blocking, time since blocking, or distance from the ditch, with the exception of non-Sphagnum bryophytes which had lower cover in quadrats adjacent to ditches that had been blocked for 5 years. Analysis of LiDAR data and the observed proximity of the water table to the peat surface led us to conclude that the subdued ecosystem responses to ditch-blocking were the result of historical peat subsidence within a 4-5 m zone either side of each ditch, which had effectively lowered the peat surface to the new, ditch-influenced water table. We estimate that this process led to the loss of around 500,000 m(3) peat within the 38 km(2) study area following drainage, due to a combination of oxidation and compaction. Assuming that 50% of the volume loss was due to oxidation, this amounts to a carbon loss of 11,000 Mg C over this area, i.e. 3 Mg C ha(-1). The apparent 'self-rewetting' of blanket bogs in the decades following drainage has implications for their restoration as it suggests that there may not be large quantities of dry peat left to rewet, and that there is a risk of inundation (potentially leading to high methane emissions) along subsided ditch lines. Many peatland processes are likely to be maintained in drained blanket bog, including support of typical peatland vegetation, but infilling of lost peat and recovery of original C stocks are likely to take longer than is generally anticipated.","2017-03-01","2025-01-08 20:47:17","2025-03-12 01:41:36","","278-286","","","188","","J.

On the ‘upstream’ side of roads, soils can become waterlogged causing either increased tree mortality, or stunted tree growth; conversely, the ‘downstream’ side may experience drying resulting in deeper root growth and increased canopy cover. Interestingly, this phenomenon is not consistent between classes of peatlands (i.e. bogs, fens, and swamps) and comparable roads may disrupt tree growth patterns in one peatland, while another may be unaffected. This study examines the conditions that maintain or alter stand structure and vegetation composition in different types of road-bisected peatlands, namely that of landscape position and mineral soil substrate composition (clay, sand, silt). I assessed tree stand structure for 96 peatlands in northeast Alberta using airborne LiDAR-derived canopy cover. Vegetation data were collected for 25 peatland sites in northeastern Alberta. These sites were subsampled with 4 plots per peatland, one pair adjacent to the road, reflecting the dry versus wet conditions, and a second pair 100 meters from the road. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) and distance-based redundancy analyses were used to evaluate relationships between LiDAR-derived canopy cover, vascular plant species richness, vegetation cover among different groups of species or species indicators, and overall species composition among different peatland types, environmental factors, landscape postion, and road characteristics. Canopy cover and tree species composition increased on the downstream side of roads and decreased on the upstream side of roads. Species richness increased in bogs on the upstream side of roads, while being comparably lower on the upstream side than on the downstream side of roads in fens. Carex limosa, Carex canescens, and Andromeda polifolia were identified as indicators of the upstream side of roads in fens, swamps, and bogs respectively, with significant differences confirmed in GLMMs. Substrate conditions below the peat further affected responses of plants, with ericaceous shrubs positively related to amount of clay, while some forbs and sedges were positively related to amount of sand. Substrate underlying the peat also influenced the effect that roads had on species composition. Bogs developed over substrates with high sand content had floristic shifts on the upstream side of the road whereas vegetation communities were similar on both sides of the road in bogs with very little sand. This study demonstrates the value of LiDAR-derived vegetation structure metrics in evaluating changes in woody vegetation structure for road-fragmented peatlands and that wetland classifications stratified with surficial geology can be a useful indicator of responses of vegetation to roads. However, responses were variable among sites due to interactions between road orientation, substrate texture, landscape position, and peatland type.","2017","2025-01-08 20:47:17","2025-03-12 01:41:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Alberta","Edmonton","","","M.Sc.","","","","","SC: 0000016","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis uses LiDAR and field sampling to determine the changes in vegetation following the construction of roads through peatlands in Alberta.</p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; vegetation; water table; flooding; remote sensing; drawdown; monitoring; roads; LiDAR; hydrological alteration; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Burning peat impacts its physical properties and chemical composition, yet the consequences of these transformations to source water quality through pollutant leaching has not been studied in detail. We combusted near-surface boreal peat under simulated peat smoldering conditions at two temperatures (250 °C and 300 °C) and quantified the concentrations of the leached carbon, nutrients and phenols from 5 g peat L−1 reverse osmosis (RO) water suspensions over a 2-day leaching period. For the conditions studied, measured water quality parameters exceeded US surface water guidelines and even exceeded EU and Canadian wastewater/sewer discharge limits including chemical oxygen demand (COD) (125 mg/L), total nitrogen (TN) (15 mg/L), and total phosphorus (TP) (2 mg/L). Phenols were close to or higher than the suggested water supply standard established by US EPA (1 mg/L). Leached carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus mainly came from the organic fraction of peats. Heating peats to 250 °C promoted the leaching of carbon-related pollutants, whereas heating to 300 °C enhanced the leaching of nutrients. Post-heated peats leached higher loads of pollutants in water than pre-heated peats, suggesting that fire-damaged boreal peats may be a critical but underappreciated source of water pollution. A simplified Partial Least Squares (PLS) model based on other easily measured parameters provided a simple method for determining the extent of COD and phenolic pollution in bulk water, relevant for water and wastewater treatment plants. Conclusions from this lab study indicate the need for field measurements of aquatic pollutants downstream of peatland watersheds post-fire as well as increased monitoring and treatment of potable water sources for leachable micropollutants in fire-dominated forested peatlands. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","2022","2025-01-08 20:47:18","2025-03-07 22:07:10","","","","","822","","Sci.

Predictive capability of land models for northern wetland CH<sub>4</sub> emissions is still low due to limited site measurements, strong spatial and temporal variability in emissions, and complex hydrological and biogeochemical dynamics. To explore this issue, we compare wetland CH<sub>4</sub> emission predictions from the Community Land Model 4.5 (CLM4.5-BGC) with site- to regional-scale observations. A comparison of the CH4 fluxes with eddy flux data highlighted needed changes to the model's estimate of aerenchyma area, which we implemented and tested. The model modification substantially reduced biases in CH<sub>4</sub> emissions when compared with CarbonTracker CH<sub>4</sub> predictions. CLM4.5 CH4 emission predictions agree well with growing season (May–September) CarbonTracker Alaskan regional-level CH4 predictions and site-level observations. However, CLM4.5 underestimated CH<sub>4</sub> emissions in the cold season (October–April). The monthly atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub> mole fraction enhancements due to wetland emissions are also assessed using the Weather Research and Forecasting-Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (WRF-STILT) model coupled with daily emissions from CLM4.5 and compared with aircraft CH<sub>4</sub> mole fraction measurements from the Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) campaign. Both the tower and aircraft analyses confirm the underestimate of cold-season CH<sub>4</sub> emissions by CLM4.5. The greatest uncertainties in predicting the seasonal CH<sub>4</sub> cycle are from the wetland extent, cold-season CH4 production and CH4 transport processes. We recommend more cold-season experimental studies in high-latitude systems, which could improve the understanding and parameterization of ecosystem structure and function during this period. Predicted CH<sub>4</sub> emissions remain uncertain, but we show here that benchmarking against observations across spatial scales can inform model structural and parameter improvements.","2016-09-13","2025-01-08 20:47:18","2025-03-07 18:21:17","","5043-5056","","17","13","","Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","4.9","2","SC: None[s0]","<p>- This paper examines the methane emissions from boreal peatalnds with discontinuous to continuous permafrost.</p>","","","climate change; peatland; greenhouse gases; carbon cycle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These seismic lines are implicated in the decline in wildlife populations that are adapted to function in unfragmented forest landscapes. In particular, anthropogenic disturbances have led to a decline of woodland caribou populations due to increasing predator access to core caribou habitat. Restoration of seismic lines aims to reduce the landscape fragmentation and stop the decline of caribou populations. However, planning restoration in complex landscapes can be challenging because it must account for a multitude of diverse aspects. To assist with restoration planning, we present a spatial network optimization approach that selects restoration locations in a fragmented landscape while addressing key environmental and logistical constraints. We applied the model to develop restoration scenarios in the Redrock-Prairie Creek caribou range in northwestern Alberta, Canada, which includes a combination of caribou habitat and active oil-and-gas and timber extraction areas. Our study applies network optimization at two distinct scales to address both the broad-scale restoration policy planning and project-level constraints at the level of individual forest sites. We first delineated a contiguous set of coarse-scale regions where restoration is most cost-effective and used this solution to solve a fine-scale network optimization model that addresses environmental and logistical planning constraints at the level of forest patches. Our two-tiered approach helps address the challenges of fine-scale spatial optimization of restoration activities. An additional coarse-scale optimization step finds a feasible starting solution for the finescale restoration problem, which serves to reduce the time to find an optimal solution. The added coarse-scale spatial constraints also make the fine-scale restoration solution align with the coarse-scale landscape features, which helps address the broad-scale restoration policies. The approach is generalizable and applicable to assist restoration planning in other regions fragmented by oil-and-gas activities.","2023-12","2025-01-08 20:47:18","2025-03-07 18:20:43","","","","","348","","J.

The interaction and consequent effects of these two trends on biodiversity have not been examined in depth. Bryophytes species can be used as indicators to measure these effects because they play key ecological roles in boreal forests. We identified and evaluated the interaction between ecosystem type (i.e., coniferous, deciduous, mixed forest and open canopy) and mining on microhabitat scale bryophyte diversity and composition in 1-km landscapes surrounding six mine sites at different stages of the mining lifecycle in the Canadian boreal forest. Irrespective of microhabitat type, the combined effects of ecosystem type and mining stage were interactive on bryophytes. Bryophyte richness and community composition were negatively affected by offsite effects of mines in only deciduous and mixed forests. The interacted effects on bryophyte richness mainly occurred on the ground r microhabitats. We also found that deciduous, mixed forests (coniferous forest as a reference) and mines had a negative impact on the abundance of feather mosses and sphagna. Furthermore, indicator species were identified for areas affected by mines (<i>Pohlia nutans</i> and <i>Dicranum polysetum</i>) and for control areas (<i>Sphagnum angustifolium </i>and <i>Plagiomnium cuspidatum</i>). Our results suggest the predicted ecosystem shifts with global changes, from coniferous to deciduous forests, could potentially increase the effects of mining on forest ecosystem resistance through the changes in bryophyte community structure. Adding microhabitats (i.e., adding coarse woody debris) near mine sites is a potential strategy to maintain species richness. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of how mining affects biodiversity and highlight the importance of considering mine offsite landscapes in future environmental evaluations of development projects in the context of global changes.","2022-11-01","2025-01-08 20:47:18","2025-03-12 01:42:49","","109555","","","144","","Ecol.

We assessed the importance of altered peat properties, such as the degree of peat decomposition and the amount of redox-sensitive phosphorus (P) compounds, for P mobilization in different degraded fens. An experimental design involving 63 intact peat cores from fens with varying drainage and land-use histories was developed to quantify the mobilization of P, as well as that of iron (Fe), ammonium, carbon dioxide, and methane, all indicators of organic-matter decomposition and/or P-releasing processes. We found that net P release rates in peat cores with highly decomposed peat (range: 0.1–52.3 mg P·m−2·d−1) were significantly correlated to the amount of P bound to redox-sensitive compounds and the molar Fe:P as well as Al:P ratios of peat. We conclude that the following general rules apply for P mobilization in rewetted fens: (1) elevated levels of P release rates and P concentrations in pore water up to three orders of magnitude larger than under natural reference conditions can only be expected for rewetted fens whose surface soil layers consist of highly decomposed peat; (2) peat characteristics, such as the amount of P bound to redox-sensitive Fe(III) compounds (positive correlation) and molar ratios of Fe:P or Al:P (negative correlations), explain the high range of P release rates; and (3) a critical P export to adjacent lakes or rivers can only be expected if molar Fe:P ratios of highly decomposed peat are less than 10.","2010","2025-01-08 20:47:18","2025-03-07 18:20:42","","1336-1349","","5","20","","Ecol.

Living moss (Sphagnum fuscum) was collected in triplicate from five ombrotrophic bogs in the AOSR after the wildfires, and analyzed for PAHs and trace elements. These post-wildfire data were compared to data from previous years at the same sites, and also to remote reference bogs in Alberta and Ontario. Elevated post-wildfire concentrations and flux of naphthalene and fluorene were observed at all five bogs in the AOSR, but no consistent trend was evident for higher molecular weight PAHs or the sum of priority PAHs (∑13PAH). Trace elements at most AOSR bogs were not elevated post-wildfire, except at one bog in the burned area (MIL), but even here the elements that were increased (1.7–5.6 × ) were likely of bitumen-origin (i.e., V, Ni, Se, Mo and Re). Significant post-wildfire correlations between PAHs and most trace elements suggested a common source, and few significant correlations were observed with retene, suggesting that wildfires were not the dominant source of most contaminants detected. Mass balance receptor models were used to apportion sources, indicating that the major sources of trace elements among five AOSR bogs post-wildfire were oil sands ore (mean 42%), haul road dust (17%), and petcoke (11%), whereas wildfire was always a minor source (3–4%). For PAHs at the most contaminated site (MIL), delayed petcoke (27%) and wildfire (25%) were the major sources, but the contribution of wildfire to PAHs at other sites was less or not discernable. Impacts of the 2016 wildfires on regional atmospheric deposition of major pollutants was less than from ongoing deposition of anthropogenic dust from oil sands activities.","2022-01-01","2025-01-08 20:47:19","2025-02-08 18:46:36","","106910","","","158","","Environ.

High water level is a key factor in maintaining C storage in peatlands, but water levels are vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. This review examines literature related to the effects of water level alteration on C cycling in peatlands to summarize new ideas and uncertainties emerging in this field. Peatland ecosystems maintain their function by altering plant community structure to adapt to changing water levels. Regarding primary production, woody plants are more productive in unflooded, well-aerated conditions, while Sphagnum mosses are more productive in wetter conditions. The responses of sedges to water level alteration are species-specific. While peat decomposition is faster in unflooded, well aerated conditions, increased plant production may counteract the C loss induced by increased ecosystem respiration (ER) for a period of time. In contrast, rising water table maintains anaerobic conditions and enhances the role of the peatland as a C sink. Nevertheless, changes in DOC flux during water level fluctuation is complicated and depends on the interactions of flooding with environment. Notably, vegetation also plays a role in C flux but particular species vary in their ability to sequester and transport C. Bog ecosystems have a greater resilience to water level alteration than fens, due to differences in biogeochemical responses to hydrology. The full understanding of the role of peatlands in global C cycling deserves much more study due to uncertainties of vegetation feedbacks, peat-water interactions, microbial mediation of vegetation, wildfire, and functional responses after hydrologic restoration.","2020-12","2025-01-08 20:47:19","2025-03-07 18:21:18","","","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4.9","2","SC: 0000079","<p>- This paper reviews the impacts of water table alteration on peatlands. </p>","","","hydrology; peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; bog; water table; flooding; drawdown; carbon cycle; fen; graminoids; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In mining environments, treatment peatlands are used in the polishing phase of water treatment to remove arsenic (among other contaminants), and peat microorganisms play a crucial role in arsenic removal. The present study assessed culture-independent diversity obtained through metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing and culture-dependent diversity obtained by isolating psychrotolerant arsenic-tolerant, arsenite-oxidizing, and arsenate-respiring microorganisms from a peatland treating mine effluent waters of a gold mine in Finnish Lapland using a dilution-to-extinction technique. Low diversity enrichments obtained after several transfers were dominated by the genera <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Polaromonas</i>, <i>Aeromonas</i>, <i>Brevundimonas</i>, <i>Ancylobacter</i>, and <i>Rhodoferax</i>. Even though maximal growth and physiological activity (i.e., arsenite oxidation or arsenate reduction) were observed at temperatures between 20 and 28°C, most enrichments also showed substantial growth/activity at 2–5°C, indicating the successful enrichments of psychrotolerant microorganisms. After additional purification, eight arsenic-tolerant, five arsenite-oxidizing, and three arsenate-respiring strains were obtained in pure culture and identified as <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Rhodococcus</i>, <i>Microbacterium</i>, and <i>Cadophora</i>. Some of the enriched and isolated genera are not known to metabolize arsenic, and valuable insights on arsenic turnover pathways may be gained by their further characterization. Comparison with phylogenetic and functional data from the metagenome indicated that the enriched and isolated strains did not belong to the most abundant genera, indicating that culture-dependent and -independent methods capture different fractions of the microbial community involved in arsenic turnover. Rare biosphere microorganisms that are present in low abundance often play an important role in ecosystem functioning, and the enriched/isolated strains might thus contribute substantially to arsenic turnover in the treatment peatland. Psychrotolerant pure cultures of arsenic-metabolizing microorganisms from peatlands are needed to close the knowledge gaps pertaining to microbial arsenic turnover in peatlands located in cold climate regions, and the isolates and enrichments obtained in this study are a good starting point to establish model systems. Improved understanding of their metabolism could moreover lead to their use in biotechnological applications intended for bioremediation of arsenic-contaminated waters.","2021-07","2025-01-08 20:47:19","2025-03-12 01:43:33","","","","","12","","","Arsenic-metabolizing microorganisms from peat","","","","","","","English","","","","","5.2","2","SC: 0000010","<p>- This paper examines the microbial flora in mine water treatment wetlands constructed in peatlands to polish mine waters, including arsenic.</p>","","","peatland; mining; peat; microbial activity; contaminant transport; pollution; impact minimization; arsenic; mine wastes; treatment wetland; mitigation hierarchy; tailings; metal/metalloid; substrate; remediation; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pools are common in natural peatlands and are important habitats for unique flora and fauna. Because of their ecological value, pools have been created in some restored peatland sites. Nevertheless, the biogeochemistry of created pools in a restoration context has seldom been studied. The objective of our study is to characterize the biogeochemistry of created pools from restored peatlands and compare them with natural pools along a chronosequence since their creation. We measured different biogeochemical variables (pH, concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic matter (DOM), base cations-calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K)-and dissolved gases-methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O)-) in 61 pools distributed over seven peatlands in eastern Canada. The sites represent a range of conditions, from natural to restored peatlands with pools ranging from 3 to 22 years old. Created and natural pools had distinctive biogeochemistry, with created pools being generally less acidic (pH >5) and 2.5 times more concentrated in nutrients (N and P) than in natural pools. DOC, N, P, dissolved gases, and base cations concentrations were lower in natural pools than in created pools, and varied between created sites. The oldest created pools (age >17 years) tend to approach the biogeochemical characteristics of natural pools, indicating that created pools may, over time, provide habitats with similar conditions to natural pools. A return of created pools to a natural pool-like biogeochemistry could thus inform on the success of peatland restoration.","2024-12","2025-01-09 17:21:51","2025-03-12 01:43:26","","","","8","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001336995000001","5","1","SC: 0000000","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the biogeochemistry of natural versus created pools after peat extraction in eastern Canada and found that created pools have more nutrients, higher pH and higher DOC than natural pools. </p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; on-site restoration; nutrients; substrate disturbance; active restoration; mitigation hierarchy; revegetation; pools/ponds; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there are still knowledge gaps about the long-term effectiveness and impact of phosphorus fertilization during the restoration of degraded boreal Sphagnum peatlands using the Moss Layer Transfer Technique. Data gathered from 114 peatland sectors restored 1 to 25 years ago, encompassing around 2900 surveyed plots in Eastern Canada, were analyzed to investigate the influence of fertilization on plant re-establishment (cover, height, and aboveground biomass accumulation) and community composition. Fertilization with a low phosphorus dosage (1.64 g P m- 2 ) of granular phosphate rock (P2O5; 2 O 5 ; NPK 0-13-0) proved to accelerate peatland vegetation recovery by favoring a shift in plant community composition towards a Sphagnum dominance. This shift was encouraged by the fast colonization of Polytrichum strictum after fertilization, a nurse plant that stabilizes the peat substrate and facilitates the subsequent establishment of Sphagnum. . Phosphorus fertilization increased by 42 % Sphagnum cover 25- year post-restoration and increased approximately by 15 % aboveground biomass accumulation 20-year post- restoration. Conversely, without fertilization, the success of restoration and long-term vegetation trajectories were uncertain. Phosphorus fertilization led to an increase in plant richness in the first 5 to 10 years after restoration and enhanced spatial heterogeneity in species composition throughout the later stages of restoration (20-25 years), suggesting that fertilization may foster dynamic, diverse plant communities. This study emphasizes fertilization's key role in restoring boreal Sphagnum peatland plant communities, especially in areas prone to episodes of freeze-thaw cycles, strongly advocating for the mandatory inclusion of phosphorus fertilization in the restoration process.","2024-10","2025-01-09 17:21:51","2025-03-07 18:20:55","","","","","298","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001299602400001","5.9","1","SC: 0000002","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates the role of phosphorus in the reestablishment of Sphagnum in post-extraction peatlands in Canada. </p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; nutrients; substrate disturbance; bryophytes; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we evaluated an alternative method of active rewetting and passive vegetation establishment using vegetation surveys and carbon dioxide and methane (CH4) flux measurements at a post-extracted fen in southern Manitoba, Canada. After one growing season post-rewetting, wetland vegetation established and the site was a net carbon sink over the growing season. However, high abundance of Carex lasiocarpa 10 years post-treatment led to higher CH4 emissions than the reference ecosystem. Successful establishment of wetland vegetation is attributed to the area being surrounded by undisturbed fens that can provide a local source of plant propagules. Bryophyte expansion was less successful than vascular plants, likely due to episodic flooding and shading from the sedge communities. Therefore, careful management of water levels to just below the peat surface is needed if reference vegetation community recovery is the goal of restoration. Water level management will also play a key role in controlling CH4 emissions to maximize carbon sequestration potential.","2023-11-23","2025-01-09 17:21:51","2025-03-18 12:38:08","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001124211800005","4.6","3","SC: 0000004","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that rewetting post-extration fen peatlands increases vegetation cover as well as improves net carbon uptake.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; greenhouse gases; substrate disturbance; carbon sequestration; rewetting; carbon cycle; fen; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; hydrological management; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This significant carbon store is under threat as peatlands continue to be degraded at alarming rates around the world. It has prompted countries worldwide to establish regulations to conserve and reduce emissions from this carbon rich ecosystem. For example, the EU has implemented new rules that mandate sustainable management of peatlands, critical to reaching the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. However, a lack of information on the extent and condition of peatlands has hindered the development of national policies and restoration efforts. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on mapping and monitoring peatlands from field sites to the globe and identifies areas where further research is needed. It presents an overview of the different methodologies used to map peatlands in nine countries, which vary in definition of peat soil and peatland, mapping coverage, and mapping detail. Whereas mapping peatlands across the world with only one approach is hardly possible, the paper highlights the need for more consistent approaches within regions having comparable peatland types and climates to inform their protection and urgent restoration. The review further summarises various approaches used for monitoring peatland conditions and functions. These include monitoring at the plot scale for degree of humification and stoichiometric ratio, and proximal sensing such as gamma radiometrics and electromagnetic induction at the field to landscape scale for mapping peat thickness and identifying hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Remote sensing techniques with passive and active sensors at regional to national scale can help in monitoring subsidence rate, water table, peat moisture, landslides, and GHG emissions. Although the use of water table depth as a proxy for interannual GHG emissions from peatlands has been well established, there is no single remote sensing method or data product yet that has been verified beyond local or regional scales. Broader land-use change and fire monitoring at a global scale may further assist national GHG inventory reporting. Monitoring of peatland conditions to evaluate the success of individual restoration schemes still requires field work to assess local proxies combined with remote sensing and modeling. Long-term monitoring is necessary to draw valid conclusions on revegetation outcomes and associated GHG emissions in rewetted peatlands, as their dynamics are not fully understood at the site level. Monitoring vegetation development and hydrology of restored peatlands is needed as a proxy to assess the return of water and changes in nutrient cycling and biodiversity.","2024-04","2025-01-09 17:21:51","2025-03-12 18:19:16","","383-425","","4","167","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001080515900001","4","2","SC: 0000043","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the state of our knowledge on carbon in peatlands reviews the methods to monitor peatland and carbon sequestration in them using a variety of techniques including remote sensing. </p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; bog; greenhouse gases; water table; carbon sequestration; remote sensing; monitoring; carbon cycle; fen; swamp; vegetation disturbance; carbon storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonetheless, restoration success relies on a sound understanding of recovery trajectories associated with different restoration techniques. Focusing on temperate/boreal Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, we used a quantitative meta-analysis of 28 studies representing 275 sites in 11 countries to test for effects of peatland status (intact, restored, and degraded), varying restoration interventions and time since restoration on vegetation as a key indicator of peatland condition and functioning. Enhanced restoration (such as active revegetation) resulted in recovery to predisturbance levels within 30-35 years for Sphagnum mosses, and 20-25 years for many other peatland specialist species, and was the only restoration approach where positive outcomes were seen across all vegetation response variables. The use of standard restoration techniques, such as rewetting, was projected to result in cover of Sphagnum mosses and peatland specialist plants reaching that of intact sites within 45-55 years post-restoration. Passive restoration (cessation of the degrading activity with no active restoration) generally elicited limited recovery of keystone peatland vegetation (Sphagnum spp.) even after multiple decades. A lack of standardization in monitoring severely constrains the analysis of peatland restoration outcomes. Increased funding for monitoring and reporting outcomes, and improved monitoring consistency, could greatly enhance our understanding of peatland restoration ecology and improve practice.","2024-03","2025-01-09 17:21:51","2025-03-07 18:20:55","","","","3","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001081487300001","3.2","2","SC: 0000016","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews and summarizes efforts to restore peatlands, mostly after peat extraction, and points to the need for active restoration and rewetting to achieve goals of the return of peatland vegetation, including sphagnum. </p> </div>","","","Canada; on-site restoration; vegetation; substrate disturbance; rewetting; monitoring; bryophytes; sphagnum; active restoration; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological management; revegetation; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following in situ oil sands well pad disturbances in the Peace River and Cold Lake Oil Sands regions in Alberta, we evaluated the efficiency of peatland restoration approaches including different groundwork and revegetation techniques. Groundwork techniques included the complete removal (CR) or partial removal (PR) of the former in situ well pads' mineral fill and revegetation included the spontaneous revegetation via natural ingress of diaspores from nearby peatlands, or managed revegetation via planting of Carex aquatilis, Larix laricina, and Salix lutea.

As brown mosses are important components in peat accumulation in fens, their low recovery rate has been a concern in the past decade. It was suggested that the restoration method used for bogs, the Moss Layer Transfer Technique (MLTT) should be adapted for fen restoration by identifying factors limiting the establishment and recovery of brown mosses. In this study, we evaluated the regeneration potential of four common brown mosses, Aulacomnium palustre, Campylium stellatum, Scorpidium cossonii and Tomentypnum niters, according to three factors that can have an impact during restoration: 1) distance of the fragment below the moss apex, 2) mechanical fragmentation of mosses, and 3) enhanced nutrient availability, and this, in growth chambers (within Petri dishes) and field experiments. Under controlled conditions, similar results were obtained for all four brown mosses studied: the severe fragmentation of mosses most drastically improved their regeneration potential. Phosphate fertilization, even at the lowest dose, increased moss regeneration, and brown mosses showed higher recovery in the first 3 cm below the apex. Liming only improved the regeneration of C. stellatum. However, unclear, and even contradicting results were obtained when treatments were applied in the field, where an overall very low establishment of brown mosses was observed in response to the rather prevailing adverse environmental conditions (e.g., erosion, frost heaving, low water table level). The direct application of some of our results into an adapted version of MLTT might be challenging, as it may require a certain level of meticulosity that large-scale mechanical fen restoration cannot provide.","2022","2025-01-09 17:21:52","2025-10-02 14:22:48","","23-35","","1","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000768795300002","0.9","4","SC: 0000004","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the regeneration of brown mosses for fen restoration and finds good success in the greenhouse, but poor success in the field, indicating the difficulty of using the moss layer transfer technique for fen restoration.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; bryophytes; active restoration; fen; mitigation hierarchy; revegetation; peat/moss extraction; brown mosses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Important fires occurring more frequently in the past decade in southern Northwest Territories (Canada) provide the opportunity to assess early post-fire vegetation regeneration in open rich fens (one, two, and five years post-fire) and to better understand early recovery succession. We aimed to (i) evaluate whether and how open rich fens are affected by fire, and (ii) describe short-term vegetation regeneration for both bryophytes and vascular species. A shift was observed between pioneer bryophytes and brown mosses between the second and fifth year post-fire. Vascular plants, especially slow-growing species and the ones reproducing mainly by seeds, recovered partially. The first bryophyte species recovering were pioneer species adapted to colonize burned environments such as Marchantia polymorpha L. or Ceratodon purpureus (Hedw.) Brid. For vascular plant species, the ones previously present and able to regrow rapidly from unburned plant structures (base of tussocks, rhizomes, roots) were represented by species like Betula glandulosa Michx. or Carex aquatilis Wahlenb. The wetter conditions and lower fuel availability of fen depressional biotopes were important factors controlling the resistance and regeneration of species associated with them.","2022-05","2025-01-09 17:21:52","2025-10-02 14:07:46","","435-447","","5","100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000788308300001","1.1","4","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the recovery of rich fens after fire in the NWT.

Indeed, Sphagnum mosses by holding water, ensure bog resistance, and by regenerating from any fragments left post-fire, ensure bog resilience. The return of several ecological attributes has been reported in the literature post-restoration. However, the resistance and resilience have not yet been evaluated in restored peatlands. A fire affecting an extracted peatland restored 10 years ago provided the opportunity to (1) evaluate the losses post-fire, in terms of phytobiomass and plant cover and (2) assess early vegetation recovery after one growing season post-fire. The fire response of the restored peatland, in terms of resistance and short-term resilience, differed between the main plant communities. Sphagnum Lawn communities (Sphagnum species from the Acutifolia subgenus and Eriophorum vaginatum) showed greater resistance to fire losing proportionally less phytobiomass (17%) than Wet Hollow communities (44%) (Sphagnum species from the Cuspidata subgenus and Scirpus cyperinus). Greater resistance of the Sphagnum Lawn likely comes from the Acutifolia Sphagnum species growing in dense carpets with good water retention, along with the E. vaginatum tussocks being able to retain humidity below the tussocks, whereas the looser growth habit of Cuspidata Sphagnum species do not have good capillary rise capacity and Scirpus produced litter that can produce a good fuel. This study reinforces the idea that a peatland restoration approach using reintroduction material dominated by Acutifolia Sphagnum species and tussock cottongrass provides a better resistance and short-term resilience of restored peatlands.","2022-04","2025-01-09 17:21:52","2025-03-19 16:03:25","","","","4","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000697891500001","3.2","2","SC: 0000013","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the resistance of restored sphagnum peatland vegetation communities to fire.

Mineral fill was either completely removed or partially removed with residual fill buried under excavated and decompacted peat, followed by the transfer of donor moss collected from nearby linear features with different plant communities in peatlands. Three years after MLTT, peatland vegetation covers 63% of the site. Carex spp. dominate with 36% coverage, followed by mosses at 12%, including 3% Sphagnum spp. and 8% fen mosses, and shrubs at 8%. Different substrate adjustment treatments and types of donor moss had negligible impact on vegetation development although areas without MLTT remained devoid of mosses and had the lowest peatland species cover. Instead, surface elevation, moisture conditions, and substrate chemistry played important roles in shaping the vegetation communities. The prompt introduction and establishment of peatland donor species through MLTT was crucial to the overall re-establishment of peatland vegetation. This is the first full pad scale study to prove that a flat, moist peat surface created by the removal and/or burial of mineral fill can support peatland vegetation development, particularly ground layer bryophytes.

We hypothesized that abiotic and biotic changes following peatland drainage would greatly accelerate litter decomposition. This hypothesis was tested by a litter decomposition experiment in an undrained and a drained area of a peatland which was partially drained 30 years ago. Litter bags filled with shoots of the peat moss Sphagnum magellanicum and leaves of the dwarf shrub Potentilla fruticosa as single species and species mixtures with three evenness treatments were placed at the surface of the peatland. After 6 months (from August onwards) of decomposition, the single species litter of Potentilla fruticosa, with low initial C/N ratio, decomposed much faster than S. magellanicum litter, with high initial C/N ratio in both undrained and drained areas. Overall, mixed litter produced antagonistic effects (observed values less than expected) on decomposition and C/N ratio. Litter mixtures dominated by S. magellanicum showed lower mass loss than other mixtures. Contrary to our expectation, the undrained area showed higher decomposition than the drained area. Our study suggests that drainage-induced alteration in plant diversity slows down litter decomposition in a short term. However, in drained peatlands, lower C/N ratio of mixed litter may enhance decomposition and reduce C sequestration over time.","2021-12","2025-01-09 17:21:52","2025-03-07 18:21:16","","883-895","","6","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000673079600002","1.8","4","SC: 0000008","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the decomposition of plant litter following long-term drawdown in a peatland.

Three years following restoration, predacious diving beetles (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) and spiders (Araneae) were sampled within and around pools using minnow traps and pitfall traps, respectively. We used Bayesian community occupancy models to document arthropod recolonization. Twenty-one dytiscid species were captured in pools. Dytiscid species richness was higher in artificial pools than in reference pools. Three dytiscid species were more likely to occur in deeper pools. Dytiscid species composition in artificial pools differed from reference pools. Seventy-seven spider species were captured around pools. Spider species richness was higher around artificial pools than around reference pools. Seventeen spider species responded to vegetation cover, either positively or negatively. In contrast, spider species composition was similar between artificial and reference pools.

However, continuous water table measurements are often scarce due to high costs and, as a result, water table depth is more commonly measured manually bimonthly with daily logs in few reference wells. A literature review identified six potential methods to estimate daily water table depth with bimonthly records and daily measurements from a reference well. A new estimation method based on the time series decomposition (TSD) is also presented. TSD and the six identified methods were compared with the water table records of an experimental peatland site with controlled water table regime located in Eastern Canada. The TSD method was the best performing method (R-2 = 0.95, RMSE = 2.48 cm and the lowest AIC), followed by the general linear method (R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 3.10 cm) and support vector machines method (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 3.24 cm). To estimate daily values, the TSD method, like the six traditional methods, requires daily data from a reference well. However, the TSD method does not require training nor parameter estimation. For the TSD method, changing the measurement frequency to weekly measurements decreases the RMSE by 16% (2.08 cm); monthly measurements increase the RMSE by 13% (2.80 cm).","2021-05","2025-01-09 17:21:52","2025-03-12 13:42:00","","","","10","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000662695900001","3.9","3","SC: 0000007","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper tests several methods to determine daily water levels based on bimonthly empirical measurements in observation wells.

Waterlogged anaerobic conditions induce accumulation of Sphagnum-derived phenolic compounds that inhibit peat organic matter decomposition, a mechanism referred to as the ""enzymic latch"".

In this study, we determined the effects of low and high frequency water table fluctuation regimes on Sphagnum growth and peat organic matter decomposition, by conducting a year-long mesocosm experiment. In addition, we conducted a molecular analysis to examine changes in abundance of fungal community which may play a key role in the decomposition of organic matter in peatlands. We found that rapid water table fluctuation inhibited the growth of Sphagnum due to fungal infection but stimulated decomposition of organic matter that may dramatically destabilize peatland carbon storage. Increased pH, induced by the fluctuation, may contribute to the enhanced activity of hydrolases in peat. We demonstrated that the water table fluctuation in peatlands impeded Sphagnum growth and accelerates decomposition due to fungal proliferation. Thus, we suggested that understanding the microbial community in the northern peatlands is essential for elucidating the possible changes in carbon cycle of peatland under the changing world.","2021-04-22","2025-01-09 17:21:52","2025-03-07 18:21:18","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000647440500001","2.9","3 (低预警)","SC: 0000029","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the response of sphagnum to water level fluctuations and finds that these fluctuations favour fungi which attach sphagnum and also facilitates decomposition.

Peatland restoration in these regions aims at reestablishing crucial peatland functions, such as peat accumulation and carbon (C) sequestration. In order to assess the success of fen restoration, we evaluated the biogeochemical conditions, the seasonal carbon balances via carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and methane (CH4) emissions, and addressed the global warming potential following different restoration techniques at two restored in-situ oil sands well pads, during two consecutive growing seasons. Restoration work involved: 1) the partial or complete removal of introduced well pad construction materials, and spontaneous revegetation, or 2) the partial removal of foreign clay, in addition to reintroduction of typical fen plant species such as Larix laricina, Salix lutea and Carex aquatilis. Comparisons were done with regional reference ecosystems (REF) consisting of three peatlands: a wooded bog, a wooded rich fen and a wooded extreme-rich fen. While the average electric conductivity of restored sectors (946 mu S cm(-1)) was higher compared to REF (360 mu S cm(-1)), the pH was quite similar (pH 5.8 REF, pH 6 restored). Dissolved organic carbon concentration was lower in all restored sectors (5-11 mg L-1 restored sectors, 15-35 mg L-1 REF), presumably due to the still incomplete recovery of vegetation and lower organic matter content associated with remnant well pad material. Re-establishment of shrub and brown moss species improved significantly the C uptake. However, the active introduction of plant species was no crucial restoration step, in order to return species beneficial for C uptake. Restoration treatments that were leveled closest to the surrounding REF showed the most similar seasonal C balance to REF. In shallow open water areas resulting from the complete removal of all construction materials, we measured the highest methane emissions making these flooded sites net C sources to the atmosphere with elevated global warming potential. The partial removal of the well pad's mineral soil to near the water table level and the surface elevation of the surrounding ecosystem seems to be the most effective site management method to sequester carbon efficiently. However, further research is needed to evaluate the suitability of this restoration method for the recovery of biodiversity and possible impacts of residual foreign materials on fen ecosystems.","2020-11-30","2025-01-09 17:21:52","2025-03-07 22:07:53","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000599658500001","2.9","3 (低预警)","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper evaluates restoration techniques for the removal of well pads on greenhouse gases, DOC and vegetation. &nbsp;The partial removal of the well pad was best for GHGs, but it is too early to determine the success of the return of vegetation.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; mine footprint; mining; greenhouse gases; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; drill pads; dissolved organic carbon; mitigation hierarchy; substrate rehabilitation; aggregate pads","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All treatments tended to increase the concentration of phenolics and suppress the activities of beta-glucosidase (measured as an indicator enzyme that plays a key role in cellulose decomposition), significantly so with the Spruce (Picea mariana) and Cedar (Thuja occidentalis) wood chips mixed into the peat. All substrate additions to the peat tended to reduce fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and significantly more so with surface additions of Spruce and Larch (Larix laricina) wood chips. The addition of woodchips per se had no detrimental effect on Sphagnum growth for any of the treatments.

Rewetting of the area affected by the ditch was carried out by the construction of six dams at 40 cm elevation intervals and felling of all trees (with diameter at breast height >10 cm) within 30 m. Water table was restored to levels similar to intact bog reference sites, only at elevation differences up to 17 cm from the nearest lower dam, while rewetting did not affect pore-water chemistry. Five to 6 years post-rewetting, the cover of both pioneer mosses, and late successional mosses (Sphagnum) had not changed significantly compared with pre-rewetting. This may have been due to the presence of dense shrub cover. For more effective ecohydrological restoration, dams should be spaced at smaller elevation intervals (e.g., every 20 cm of elevation or less), to allow recovery of water table along the entire length of the ditch, and vegetation introduction using the moss layer transfer technique may accelerate Sphagnum recruitment, especially in the few first metres from the ditch.","2020-07","2025-01-09 17:21:52","2025-03-10 17:40:30","","","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000527872200001","2.6","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the hydrological and vegetation changes following the rewetting of a long-drained section of a peatland near Québec.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; water table; drawdown; rewetting; active restoration; mitigation hierarchy; peat dams; hydrological management; revegetation; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to assess the most appropriate fertilizer dose for P. mariana establishment and growth against the trade-off of birch invasion; consequently, we monitored the effect of B. papyrifera on P. mariana growth. Four levels of fertilizer dose were applied below-ground, but flooding of the site following planting allowed fertilizer to reach the surface and favoured the colonisation of B. papyrifera. Seven years after planting, fertilizer promoted P. mariana survival and the highest fertilizer dose improved both P. mariana and B. papyrifera growth, while the lowest fertilizer dose promoted spruce growth, to a lesser degree, without promoting birch growth as much as higher doses of fertilizer. Birch removal had a significant positive effect on the growth of P. mariana, possibly by allowing greater light penetration and higher near-surface soil moisture. Avoiding B. papyrifera colonisation on site is more effective than cutting due to the ability of birch to regenerate rapidly from stumps. In practice, if planting coniferous trees is the chosen restoration option, the risk of birch colonisation can be minimised by leaving a thicker remnant peat deposit, burying fertilizer near the planted seedlings, and planning planting to avoid flooding during the growing season post-planting whenever possible.","2020","2025-01-09 17:21:52","2025-03-07 22:07:54","","","","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000532713800001","1.2","4","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of natural colonization by native birch (<em>Betula papyrifera</em>) on the success of planting of black spruce to restore peatlands in western Canada. &nbsp;Birch impedes the growth of spruce, but cutting birch after seven years was efficient to allow spruce to take over.</p> </div>","","","Canada; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; invasive species; mitigation hierarchy; woody plants; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We asked to what degree natural ecotones at undisturbed reference fens can act as models for the restoration of artificial ecotones around an extracted peatland, and whether management actions can ameliorate conditions in artificial ecotones. We compared changes in elevation, water table, peat, and multiple vegetation characteristics between natural ecotones and unmanaged artificial ecotones. We then clear-cut peripheral strips, completely filled perimeter canals, and smoothed peripheral slopes around sections of the extracted surfaces to assess whether hydrological conditions improved. Without management, artificial ecotones are not good models of natural ecotones. The elevation gradient is steep, and water tables drop steeply within 8 m of blocked perimeter canals, with possible effects at 25 m. The consequent vegetation had denser tree saplings, faster tree growth, almost no moss cover, and low moss species richness. After these management actions, water tables increased to within approximately 5 cm of those along natural ecotones.

We aimed to evaluate (1) the regeneration of vegetation, especially of Sphagnum mosses, to determine which harvesting practices are best to enhance recovery and (2) the influence of the site hydrological conditions and meteorological variables of the first complete growing season postharvesting on peat moss regeneration. Twenty-five donor sites covering a 17-year chronosequence (harvested 1-17 years ago) were inventoried along with 15 associated natural reference sites located in Quebec, New Brunswick, and Alberta, Canada. All donor sites aged 10 years or more were dominated by Sphagnum mosses, though plant composition varied between donor and their associated reference sites because of the wetter conditions at harvested donor sites. Harvesting practices strongly influenced donor site recovery, showing that the skills of the practitioner are an essential ingredient. Harvesting practices minimizing donor site disturbances are recommended, such as the choice of the adequate donor site (localization, hydrologic conditions, vegetation), the use of less disruptive methods, and harvesting when the soil is deeply frozen.

In peatlands restored after peat extraction, the typical communities associated with pools generally fail to re-establish if only the moss layer transfer technique is applied, a common approach on flat bare peatlands. To adapt peatland ecological restoration methods for recolonizing shallow wet fen habitats, this study investigates the response of plant communities re-establishing in wet depressions subjected to four revegetation strategies. In a restored fen (southeastern Quebec, Canada), 48 depressions were dug out and revegetated with 1) mosses, 2) Carex species, 3) Scirpus validus, or 4) through spontaneous colonization (control treatment without implanted species). After four growing seasons, plant community structure and composition were surveyed in and outside the revegetated area respectively to test whether reintroduced communities had a propensity to extend beyond the central wet depression. Restoration strategies strongly impacted plant communities. Moss-revegetated wet depressions had higher moss and vascular fen-specialist species richness and distinct species assemblages relative to other treatments. Carex treatment increased only vascular cover compared to control, while Scirpus validus treatment did not differ from control. The positive impact of moss transfer was local and limited to core revegetated areas, as transferred plant material did not colonize any further. Our results suggest that transferring moss in created wet depressions is an effective strategy to foster the recolonization of diverse and distinct plant assemblages, and thereby restore local fen biodiversity hotspots.","2018-12","2025-01-09 17:21:53","2025-10-02 13:47:53","","19-24","","","151","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000448091000003","1.8","3","SC: 0000011","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of moss transfers and transplanting sedges to restore plant communities around wet depressions in fens, as compared to letting passive regeneration proceed.

Data collection included three growing seasons for herbs and shrubs and two growing seasons for belowground biomass, trees and bryophytes. Average NPP for above and belowground biomass of three selected natural basin fens were 450 g m(-2) yr(-1). Belowground NPP represented 45% of the total NPP. Sphagnum warnstorfii was the most productive bryophyte (140 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and the slowest plant species to decompose (exponential decomposition constant k = 0.07 yr(-1)). The brown mosses Tomenthypnum nitens, Campylium stellatum and Scorpidium cossonii had a NPP of 79, 69 and 92 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, and decomposed at the same rate (identical k values of 0.14 yr(-1)). Trees covered a large surface area in the fens, with an average NPP of 73 g m(-2) yr(-1). S. warnstorfii contributed to hummocks having a higher peat accumulation potential than lawn vegetation. The graminoid Trichophorum cespitosum significantly increased NPP in lawns and should be targeted in restoration plans for fens. To restore peat accumulating processes (production and decomposition) in fens, bryophytes should be the primary focus for re-introduction, specifically species that are adapted to living in drier conditions, such as hummock species. The range of variability for NPP and decomposition established by this study should be considered as a decision tool in restoration projects to monitor restored ecosystems trajectories and successes.","2018-08","2025-01-09 17:21:53","2025-10-02 13:38:59","","105-115","","","91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000444520600011","6.9","2","SC: 0000015","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the primary productivity and decomposition of bryophytes and vascular plants in natural fens as a reference for primary productivity and decomposition in restored fens in southern Québec.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; decomposition; monitoring; carbon cycle; primary productivity; bryophytes; sphagnum; fen; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; reference conditions; brown mosses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One field experiment tested which peatland plant communities (Shrubby Rich Fen, Treed Rich Fen) would best colonize different substrates (sawdust, clay loam, mix sawdust-clay, peat, surface roughness). We found that the moss layer transfer technique (MLTT) facilitated the establishment of peatland communities on residual mineral soil used to construct the pad, when shaved back to an average water level of the surrounding wetland. The choice of peatland plant community is key to the introduction of bryophytes. Peat amendment facilitated the establishment of plants, whereas soil decompaction had no effect.

We measured C stored in P. mariana biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from bare peat at each of four fertilizer doses. Carbon stored in biomass of Betula papyrifera (Marsh.) that had spontaneously colonized the postfertilized site was also determined. Given that the water table remained very deep and that the sphagnum moss-ericaceous shrub peat-accumulating vegetation was not present, the site remained a source of C when only the planted P. mariana trees were considered, primarily in the form of CO2 emissions by soil respiration. However, C accumulation in trees, including B. papyrifera biomass, resulted in a net C sink in fertilized plots.

Based on the paleoecological analysis of four peat cores and the characterization of 13 contemporary natural sites, the reference ecosystem for minerotrophic peatlands in southeastern Canada is composed of two broad categories of plant assemblages described as tall-sedge and Sphagnum-Thuja/brown moss. In paleoecological peat profiles, tall-sedge communities were found at the transition between aquatic and terrestrial, and were associated with high graminoid production, riverine peatlands, and elevated water table in the present-day analyses. Sphagnum-Thuja communities resemble the present-day vegetation found in natural basin type peatlands. Except for Sphagnum warnstorfii Russ., these communities, with high taxonomical diversity, contain more generalist species from boreal peatland vegetation, such as Rhododendron groenlandicum (Oeder) Kron & Judd, Thuja occidentalis L., Linnaea borealis L., and Maianthemum trifolium L. They grow in dryer or shady habitats such as hummocks or forest understory. The importance of brown mosses was revealed by paleoecological analysis. Overall, findings from both approaches are complementary: paleoecological stratigraphy informs us about past ecosystem dynamics, while present-day inventories allow us to define current plant communities and their major environmental characteristics.

Firstly, to assist decision making in peatland management, baseline ecological conditions, peat physicochemistry and spontaneous vegetation recolonization were assessed for 18 of these fields. This first study revealed that (1) concentrations of several macro-nutrients are almost one order of magnitude lower for unrestored fields than previously characterized natural lagg habitats of the same region, and (2) there is little spontaneous colonization. In a second study, peat chemistry and soil/air microclimate were evaluated in plantations established on shallow residual peat (a 21-year-old Larix laricina plantation and an 18-year-old Picea mariana plantation) and compared to adjacent unrestored shallow bare-peat fields. This second study showed that afforested peat fields are characterized by (1) a soil enriched in nutrients, notably in N, P, and K, and (2) a more humid and cooler microclimate at the soil/air interface, with less daily humidity and temperature fluctuations. These results indicate that afforestation is an appropriate approach to start an ecological recovery. Yet, the absence of natural recolonization by herbs and mosses in the understory of afforested peat fields suggests that reintroduction of appropriate understory species should also be considered if the goal is to restore a fully functional ecosystem.","2017-04","2025-01-09 17:21:53","2025-03-20 18:54:42","","177-190","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000398185800004","1.8","4","SC: 0000015","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the ecological conditions around the edges of post-extraction peatlands in relation to their restoration using tree plantations. </p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; nutrients; substrate disturbance; active restoration; passive restoration; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; woody plants; revegetation; ecotone; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Depending on the site conditions, we suggest applying two restoration techniques to restore peatlands in areas of exposed sedge peat. In areas where sparse cover of fen species may have spontaneously established, rewetting should be carried out to raise water levels and create favourable conditions for their expansion. In areas covered with undesirable species or with inadequate topography for rewetting, surface peat should be remodeled and vegetation introduced.

Peat fields were rectangular in shape, cambered in cross-section profile, and separated by drainage ditches. Common to all peat fields were symmetrical patterns in micro-topography with slopes between differences in elevation. Saline non-waterlogged slopes of similar to 5% occurred as a symmetrical pair on each side of the crest of the cambered profile, at one end of each peat field. Three rows were laid across this slope (Top, Middle, and Bottom rows) and transplanted with naturally-growing plant species with their sand substrate, in three experiments, and grown for a year. In the Spartina pectinata experiment, bare root stem sections were also planted. Another experiment was conducted to determine changes in the characteristics of a volume of sand when incubated in saline peat fields. We found the salinity of peat increased with moisture downslope, and pH decreased with increase in salinity. S. pectinata grew best when planted with its sand substrate compared with bare root stem section, and when planted in Bottom rows. Juncus balticus had excellent growth in all rows. Unexpectedly, Festuca rubra that was inconspicuous beneath the J. balticus canopy in the natural donor site grew densely within the J. balticus sods. Agrostis stolonifera grew well but seemed to show intolerance to the surrounding acidic peat by curling up its stolons. The pH of the incubated sand volume was much higher than the surrounding peat.

This is particularly true for the common reed (Phragmites australis), one of the most invasive species in North America. For the first time, we combined insitu field observations and genetic evidence, based on two genotyping techniques, that is microsatellite markers (SSR) and genotyping by sequencing (GBS), to determine the propagation strategies of this invader at its northern distribution limit in North America and especially in roadside ditches. Field observations revealed that, in a region where the common reed is already abundant, both seeds and plant fragments contributed to the establishment of new populations. Newly established individuals originated mostly (84%) from seeds rather than fragments, but a larger proportion of individuals originating from fragments survived the second year compared to seedlings. High genetic diversity among marsh and roadside common reed stands indicated the prime role of sexual reproduction for dispersal. The vast majority of genotypes were found in only one stand; such high genetic variability can only be explained by sexual reproduction. Half the surveyed stands comprised a single clone, suggesting that local expansion mainly occurred vegetatively. As the small proportion of SSR genotypes initially thought to be common between distant stands proved to be distinct (as revealed by GBS data), it is likely that all the stands examined were initially founded by genetically distinct individuals.Synthesis. Our study suggests that long-distance dispersal by seeds is important for the common reed, in marshes and roadsides, while both seeds and plant fragments contribute to short-distance dispersal along roads, at least in regions where the species is already abundant. The success of this invader in North America seems to be attributable to a reproduction strategy combining the advantages of sexuality with those of vegetative propagation. Moreover, this study shows that the GBS approach strongly reduces uncertainties associated with the use of a limited number of markers. This approach is especially valuable for ecologists dealing with an ever-increasing number of invaders, of which few have identified microsatellite markers.","2015-11","2025-01-09 17:27:14","2025-09-26 14:14:03","","1529-1537","","6","103","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000363339300016","5.5","1","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the causes for the spread of <em>Phragmites</em> in eastern North America, especially along road sides. <em>Phragmites</em> can be expected to spread along roads into the Ring-of-Fire region. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; vegetation; vascular plants; other wetland; roads; invasive species; graminoids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Low water levels predicted for several fluvial systems make wetlands especially vulnerable to the spread of invaders, such as the common reed (Phragmites australis), one of the most invasive species in North America. We developed a model to map the distribution of potential germination grounds of the common reed in freshwater wetlands of the St.Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada) under current climate conditions and used this model to predict their future distribution under two climate change scenarios simulated for 2050. We gathered historical and recent (remote sensing) data on the distribution of common reed stands for model calibration and validation purposes, then determined the parameters controlling the species establishment by seed. A two-dimensional model and the identified parameters were used to simulate the current (2010) and future (2050) distribution of germination grounds. Common reed stands are not widespread along the St.Lawrence River (212ha), but our model suggests that current climate conditions are already conducive to considerable further expansion (>16,000ha). Climate change may also exacerbate the expansion, particularly if river water levels drop, which will expose large bare areas propitious to seed germination. This phenomenon may be particularly important in one sector of the river, where existing common reed stands could increase their areas by a factor of 100, potentially creating the most extensive reedbed complex in North America. After colonizing salt and brackishwater marshes, the common reed could considerably expand into the freshwater marshes of North America which cover several million hectares. The effects of common reed expansion on biodiversity are difficult to predict, but likely to be highly deleterious given the competitiveness of the invader and the biological richness of freshwater wetlands.","2015-08","2025-01-09 17:27:14","2025-03-12 01:49:48","","3421-3435","","16","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000360177400017","2.6","2","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the spread of phragmites in wetlands in Québec and point to the increase in spread as a result of climate change.</p> </div>","","","Canada; climate change; peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; other wetland; invasive species; graminoids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we discuss ecological patterns and processes in roadside habitats important for understanding the invasion dynamics of common reed from coastal areas inland. Frequent disturbances in roadsides combined with potentially high levels of nutrients from adjacent land and stress conditions (from deicing salt and other pollutants) mimic the conditions unfortunately found more and more in natural wetlands. The novel contribution of roads is the creation of linear wetlands with an unprecedented level of connectivity. Genetic evidence shows that invasion inland coincides with the intensification of the road network. Time series analysis of remote sensing data reveals impressive rates of invasion of roadsides and other linear infrastructures, suggesting prime conditions for common reed in these novel habitats. Whereas reed dispersal along roads was thought to be largely due to rhizome transport, new evidence suggests a significant contribution of sexual reproduction and seedling establishment, likely enhanced by climate warming at northern latitudes. There is little evidence that other wetland plants can slow down vegetative expansion of common reed in roadside habitats, but plant cover could prevent seedling establishment and shading by shrubs and trees limit lateral clonal expansion. The fact that common reed possibly provides water treatment and other ecosystem services in roadsides must be carefully weighed against the threat to biodiversity in natural systems. All this begs for investigating urgently if, where, and how we should intervene without compromising the great value of wetlands of conservation interest intersected by roads.","2010-10","2025-01-09 17:27:14","2025-03-12 01:49:48","","506-514","","4","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000291707800016","1.1","4","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the modes of invasion of <em>Phragmites</em> in North America and concludes that sexual and asexual movement along roadways is the primary mechanisms, especially where roads intersect wetlands.

Roads provide suitable conditions for the establishment and growth of exotic species. Most roads are bordered by drainage ditches forming a network of linear wetlands. Drainage ditches may serve as habitats and corridors facilitating the spread of aquatic invaders into the intersected ecosystems. The common reed Phragmites australis is one of these aquatic invaders frequently found in marshes and drainage ditches along roads. We hypothesized that highways have acted as corridors for the dispersal of the common reed and have contributed to the invasion of North American wetlands by this species. 2. We mapped the spatial distribution of the common reed along the highway network of the province of Quebec, Canada, where a large-scale invasion of this plant species has been reported since the 1960s. We also identified the genotype of common reed colonies using molecular tools and the main characteristics that favour the presence of the common reed in road ditches. 3. Approximately 67% of the 1359 1-km highway sections surveyed during summer 2003 in Quebec had at least one common reed colony. End to end, common reed colonies totalled 324 km, i.e. 24% of the 1359 km surveyed. 4. Common reed colonies located along the highways were largely (99%) dominated by the exotic (Eurasian) genotype (haplotype M). 5. The common reed was more abundant along highways located in warm regions, with a sum of growing degree-days (> 5 degrees C, 12-month period) >= 1885, along highways built before the 1970s and in agricultural regions dominated by corn and soybean crops. Common reed colonies were larger when located along highways that were wide, built before the 1970s or in warm regions. This was particularly apparent if the roadside was bordered by a wetland. On the other hand, common reed colonies were more likely to be narrow when located near a woodland. 6. Synthesis and applications. Several disturbances (de-icing salts, ditch digging and agricultural nitrogen input) favour the development of large common reed colonies along roads, some of them expanding out of roadsides, particularly in wetlands. Reducing disturbances, leaving (or planting) a narrow (a few metres) hedge of trees or shrubs along highways or planting salt-resistant shrubs in roadside ditches could be efficient ways to slow the expansion of common reed or to confine the species to roadsides.","2008-04","2025-01-09 17:27:14","2025-03-12 01:49:53","","459-466","","2","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000254192500008","5.7","1","SC: 0000221","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the spread of phragmites in Québec and point to the role of highways for its spread. &nbsp;It spreads especially in southern latitudes of the province. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; vegetation; vascular plants; other wetland; roads; invasive species; graminoids; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We reconstructed the spread of reed canarygrass in Quebec using herbarium specimens and a method that accounts for some of the biases associated with this type of historical record. We hypothesized that the beginning of the spread of the species coincided with the introduction in Canada of reed canarygrass cultivars for forage. Reed canarygrass specimens collected during the 19(th) century in places as remote as Lake Mistassini and Anticosti Island provide strong evidence that this species is native to northeastern North America. The spatial distribution of specimens collected before 1925 suggests that reed canarygrass probably occupied most of its present-day area at that time. There is no strong evidence that reed canarygrass expanded its distribution limits in Quebec during the 20(th) century. However, the species colonized several new sites within its distribution limits in recent decades, especially from 1963 to 1978. The spread was probably associated with nitrate pollution and road construction in southern Quebec, and with water level fluctuations of the St. Lawrence River. Although herbarium specimens suffer from sampling biases, their use may provide new spatio-temporal insights into the spread of invasive species and facilitate the identification of probable causes of invasiveness.","2005","2025-01-09 17:27:14","2025-03-12 01:49:53","","366-375","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000232582200009","1.3","4","SC: 0000081","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the cause for the spread of reed canary grass (<em>Canary reed grass</em>) in Québec.

Location: Bas-Saint-Laurent region, southeastern Quebec, Canada. Methods: Data (species assemblages, abiotic and spatio-historical variables) were collected in 16 bogs ranging from 2 to 189 ha. and incorporated in a geographical information system. Major gradients in vegetation composition were identified using DCA. CCA was used to relate vegetation gradients to abiotic and spatio-historical variables. Results: A clear segregation of species assemblages was observed, from open and undisturbed bogs to forested and highly disturbed sites. Among abiotic factors, tree basal area. water table level and peat thickness had a significant influence on plant species composition. Among spatio-historical factors. disturbance level, area loss and fire were the most influential factors. Variance partitioning between these groups of factors suggests that spatio-historical factors had a major influence on peatlands. representing 22% of the variation observed in the plant species assemblages while abiotic factors represent only 17% of the variation. Conclusions: The results highlight the influence of agricultural and other anthropogenic activities on plant assemblages and suggest that even wetlands apparently resistant to disturbances. such as peatlands, can be severely affected by anthropogenic factors. Plant species assemblages of ombrotrophic peatlands of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region were, and still are, largely influenced by human activities.","2004-11","2025-01-09 17:27:14","2025-03-07 18:19:53","","183-192","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000225645800005","2.8","3","SC: 0000065","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper looks at the controls for natural recolonization of post-extracted peatlands in southern Québec.

Vegetation surveys were carried out in 1994 and 1998. The presence/absence of all species of vascular and non-vascular plants along eight 264-m long transects was noted in both years. The height structure of the invading birch (Betula spp.) population was also reconstructed in 1998. Only 11 plant species were sampled in 1994 at the vacuum-mined site. The 1998 survey added only five other species to the list. Nevertheless, the 1994 and 1998 vegetation surveys were significantly different, particularly because the cover of four ericaceous shrub species (Chamaedaphne calyculata, Kalmia angustifolia, Ledum groenlandicum, Vaccinium angustifolium) had increased since 1994. Height structure of the birch population indicated that seedlings were very numerous at the study site, but few of them will probably survive to their first or second growing season. This suggests that the natural revegetation of the Cacouna bog's vacuum-mined (mechanically harvested) site is slowly converging towards that of most block-cut mined (manually harvested) sites in southern Quebec; i.e., a dense plant cover dominated by ericaceous shrub species. However, no Sphagnum species had established eight years after abandonment of the vacuum-mined section. This indicates that the site is not returning to a functional peatland ecosystem. Additional restoration measures should be elaborated to accelerate the revegetation process.","2000-04","2025-01-09 17:27:14","2025-03-07 22:06:55","","279-286","","2","114","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000089260000013","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the natural recolonization of plants on peatlands where peat was extracted using vacuum extraction and points the poor natural recolonization. </p> </div>","","","Canada; vegetation; substrate disturbance; monitoring; passive restoration; vegetation sampling; revegetation; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Quebec (Canada), it has recently been suggested that gray birch (Betula populifolia Marsh.) is spreading rapidly eastward. We tested the hypothesis that this tree migration is strongly facilitated by human activities. Herbarium specimens, historical landscape reconstructions, botanical surveys in mined peatlands and old fields, and dendrochronological data were used to reconstruct past and recent distribution limits of gray birch in the study area (Bas-Saint-Laurent region). Gray birch has been present in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region since at least 1945. However, herbarium specimens and botanical surveys indicate that gray birch individuals were scarce before 1970. The introduction of gray birch in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region seems to be associated with peat mining activities. All mined peatlands located between Riviere-Ouelle and Isle-Verte were colonized by gray birch, but only 11% of old fields surveyed contained at least one gray birch individual. This suggests that the spread of an early successional tree species in an agricultural landscape is facilitated more by the presence of a few large patches favorable to the growth of the species (mined peatlands) than by numerous small patches (old fields). The recent expansion of gray birch populations in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region could be a major concern for peat mining companies because massive invasions of gray birch in abandoned mined bogs may impede successful restoration of these ecosystems.","1999-06","2025-01-09 17:27:14","2025-03-07 22:06:55","","859-868","","6","77","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000083454300010","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the spread of gray birch in post-extraction peatlands in southern Québec and finds that these birch prefer post-extracted peatlands. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; substrate disturbance; passive restoration; invasive species; woody plants; revegetation; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research quantifies how seismic lines alter soil hydrophysical properties, hydrologic properties and snow accumulation patterns at two sites south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. During 2021 and 2022, water table levels were measured weekly during the summer months and were paired with measurements of soil properties (bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, porosity and specific yield) on seismic lines and in the adjacent matrix. Bulk density increased on seismic lines by 19% and 113% in lowland and upland ecosystems, respectively. Saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased on seismic lines by one order of magnitude for both upland and lowland ecosystems. Water table variability was increased on seismic lines, but depth to water table was related to external factors such as topographic position. Snow measurements in March 2022 indicated that snow water equivalent was greater on seismic lines that were oriented in the East-West (EW) direction and on lines that were widest compared to SWE within the adjacent matrix. Our results provide information to researchers and industry on the alteration of important ecosystem factors on seismic lines that may limit line recovery trajectories.

Despite partial recovery on forested seismic lines, peatland recovery is often arrested, impacting wildlife and carbon dynamics. Restoration efforts employ silviculture techniques to create microtopography and foster tree growth, but the efficacy of restoration treatments in restoring peatland plant diversity remains uncertain. We compared taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of understory plant communities across treated and untreated seismic lines, alongside reference sites in treed bogs and fens. Treated lines generally had a twofold increase in plant height, leaf dry matter content, and foliar nitrogen and phosphorus contents compared to reference sites. In bogs, treated lines differed from reference conditions driven by increases in herbaceous taxa, while fens displayed disparities mainly in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity. Differential responses of bogs and fens underline the necessity for tailored management strategies. Changes in plant diversity away from restoration targets have implications for ecosystem recovery, emphasizing the importance of long-term monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of silviculture techniques in restoring boreal peatland plant communities.","2024-11","2025-01-09 17:29:48","2025-03-07 22:07:55","","438-451","","11","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001333328500001","1.1","4","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the recover of restored seismic lines through fens and bogs as compared to natural sites and find that vegetation differs and tissue nutrient contents are higher in restored sites than in reference sites. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; on-site restoration; seismic lines; vegetation; bog; microtopography; fen; mitigation hierarchy; functional types; physiography; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite their ubiquitous nature, little is known about their influence on over-winter meteorological conditions and if and how they alter the snowpack and soil temperature profiles through altered energy and water balances in the wintertime. The presence of seismic lines could affect hydrological processes in both the wintertime and warm months. This will then affect plant communities and carbon cycling on these disturbances. Thus, understanding the effect of seismic lines on meteorological conditions during cold weather conditions will be important to better understand how they alter ecosystem function. Accordingly, this study aims to assess the effect of two seismic lines with different orientations created for petroleum resource exploration on energy and meteorological variables by comparing them with the near surface conditions in the adjacent wooded peatland area from October 2022 to April 2023. We observed 1.8 times higher photon flux density of photosynthetically active radiation on the linear disturbances than in the understory of the undisturbed locations and a greater negative net radiation on the seismic lines compared with that observed off the lines. Furthermore, the average wind speed on the seismic lines were eight and seven times higher at the east-west and south-north oriented seismic lines than the adjacent wooded peatland, respectively. Together, these changes resulted in a denser snowpack on the seismic line and overall higher snow water equivalent in the pre-melt snowpack. This provided insulation for the soil, and soil temperature on the lines stayed above freezing 7 days longer at the east-west oriented site or retained non-freezing condition at the south-north oriented site in the upper 15 cm. This would result in more microbial activity and potential higher over-winter carbon releases. Seasonal soil temperature series on seismic lines and adjacent wooded peatlands from October 2022 to April 2023. The period of frozen soil conditions is reduced on the seismic line, likely due to changes in snowpack. Warmer soils on seismic lines have implications for overwinter microbial activity that could increase organic matter decomposition. image","2024-07","2025-01-09 17:29:48","2025-03-07 22:06:57","","","","7","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001278986800001","3.2","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of seismic lines on winter soil temperature and microbial activity and consequent greenhouse gas production. </p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; seismic lines; soil temperature; soil warming; microbial activity; substrate disturbance; microclimate; mineral exploration; snowpack; climate; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the above- and below-ground carbon stocks and growing season carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from a representative boreal coniferous swamp in northern Alberta, Canada in 2022. Tree inventories, understory vegetation biomass and peat cores were collected across three sub-sites within the broader swamp, with gas flux collars placed in the dominant plant communities present. Alongside the C flux measurements, environmental variables such as water table depth, soil temperature and growing season understory green leaf phenology were measured. Our results show that these boreal coniferous swamps store large volumes of organic C in their biomass and soil (134 kg C m-2), comparable with other wetland and forest types, although 95% of the total C stock at our site was within the soil organic carbon. We also found that understory CO2 and CH4 fluxes indicated that the ground layer of the site is a source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere across the growing season. However, we did not measure litterfall input, tree GHG fluxes or net primary productivity of the overstory, therefore we are not able to say whether the site is an overall source of C to the atmosphere. This study provides a much-needed insight into the C dynamics of these under-valued wetland ecosystems, and we highlight the need for a coordinated effort across boreal regions to try to improve inventories of C stocks and fluxes. Compared to other wetland types across Canada, boreal conifer swamps do not receive the same level of scientific attention and therefore our understanding of how much carbon they potentially store and release is limited. To fill this knowledge gap, our study measured how much carbon was stored both in the trees and within the soil itself, alongside measurements of carbon uptake and release within a representative conifer swamp wetland in Western Canada. We found that although these wetlands may function similarly to other wetland types, by ignoring them, we are missing out on large amounts of carbon being stored in these systems. We also found that at the ground layer, these sites are a source of carbon, that is, releasing more carbon than is being taken up by the understory moss and plant layer. However, we cannot say if the site overall is a source of carbon to the atmosphere as we were unable to measure other key components of a wetland carbon cycle including litterfall input and the productivity of the trees themselves. Our findings indicate that by not including these wetlands in modeling of carbon dynamics, we are missing a substantial component of boreal carbon cycling processes.

The communities were similar at sites restored in 1991 and 2009 (25 and 7 years prior to our research) that had high water table and were dominated by sedges. A different, shared pattern of microbial membership was observed at natural, unrestored, and actively extracted sites, and a site restored in 2012 (4 years prior to the research). These similarities were reflected in peat chemistry and hydrology in canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) ordination that was used to investigate how these factors affected the abundances of methane cycling taxa. Based on the CCA, methanotrophs reached their highest abundances close to the water table, at high and moderate concentrations of phosphate and propionate, and low concentrations of formate. Methanogens exhibited a more distributed pattern, with organisms responding to opposite conditions along these environmental gradients.

Industry is testing peatland construction as part of landscape reclamation. To determine if constructed peatlands can be self-sustaining, an understanding of the cycling of solutes in pore water and their interactions with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is needed since DOC can represent an important carbon loss from peatlands. DOC is of interest due to its biotic origin and use by the microbial community and impact on carbon budgets. Additionally, salinity as a control on DOC quantity and quality may be important in oil sands reclaimed systems due to the likelihood of elevated sodium (Na+) from saline groundwater input derived from tailings used to construct catchments, and natural sources. For this research, DOC concentration and quality, and Na+ concentration were measured in the rooting zone (10 and 30 cm depth) of Nikanotee Fen to evaluate the role of Na+ in DOC dynamics. DOC concentration and quality suggested that DOC in the fen was largely sourced from vegetation inputs, with quality also suggesting increases in vegetation inputs between years. Elevated Na+ at 30 cm below ground surface corresponded with high concentrations of labile DOC. At 10 cm below ground surface, sampling location and temperature were the best predictors of DOC concentration and quality. With expected increases in Na+, increased production of mobile and microbially active DOC may lead to higher rates of carbon export.","2023-04","2025-01-09 17:29:49","2025-03-08 14:23:49","","","","4","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000960869200001","3.2","3","SC: 0000000","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the dynamics of DOC ion response to salinity in a constructed fen for mine reclamation in the Alberta oil sands region. </p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; on-site restoration; mining; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; mine reclamation; fen; dissolved organic carbon; mitigation hierarchy; salinity; mine planning; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We determine the effect that production duration (years of extraction) has on the CO2 and CH4 emissions from an actively extracted peatland over 3 years of measurements (2018-2020). We studied five sectors identified by the year when extraction began (1987, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016). Greater average CO2 and CH4 emissions were measured from the drainage ditches (CO2: 2.05 +/- 0.12 g C m(-2) d(-1); CH4: 72.0 +/- 18.0 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) compared to the field surface (CO2: 0.9 +/- 0.06 g C m(-2) d-1; CH4: 9.2 +/- 4.0 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) regardless of sector. For peat fields, CO2 fluxes were highest in the youngest sector, which opened in 2016 (1.5 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2 )d(-1)). The four older sectors all had similar mean CO2 fluxes (similar to 0.65 g C m(-2) d(-1)) that were statistically different from the mean 2016 CO(2 )flux. A spatial effect on CO2 fluxes was observed solely within the 2016 sector, where CO2 emissions were highest from the centre of the peat field and declined towards the drainage ditches. These observations occur due to operators contouring surfaces to facilitate drainage. The domed shape and subsequent peat removal resulted in a difference in surface peat age hence different humification and lability. In addition, C-14 dating confirmed that the peat contained within the 2016 sector was younger than peat within the 2007 sector and that peat age is younger toward the centre of the field in both sectors. Humification indices derived from mid-infrared spectrometry (MIRS) (1630/1090 cm(-1)) indicated that peat humification increases with increasing years of extraction. Laboratory incubation experiments showed that CO2 production potentials of surface peat samples from the 2016 sector increased toward the centre of the field and were greater than for samples taken from the 1987 and 2007 sectors. Our results indicate that peatlands under extraction are a net source of C, where emissions are high in the first few years after opening a field for extraction and then decline to about half the initial value and remain at this level for several decades, and the ditches remain a 2 to 3 times greater source than the fields but represent < 3.5 % of the total area of a field.","2023-02-15","2025-01-09 17:29:49","2025-03-19 16:04:04","","737-751","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000936648000001","4.9","2","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the duration of peat extraction on greenhouse gas emissions from actively-extracted peatlands in southeastern Canada.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; greenhouse gases; peat; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; substrate; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although seismic line restoration has been observed to improve tree growth and survival, application in peatlands has been shown to alter ecosystem functions such as hydrology and carbon storage. The most common active restoration method is called mechanical mounding, where the classic technique inverts the peat profile. New mounding methods that maintain the peat profile may provide benefits by preserving existing vegetation and reducing disturbance. To determine the effects of different mounding methods on soil quality, we collected and analyzed peat cores from two different sites for various soil properties (C/N ratios, 813C, 815N, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy humification indices). Vegetation surveys were also conducted. The two sites are both a collection of seismic lines crossing poor fens in Alberta. One site was treated with the classic method, while the other was treated with two new mounding methods. Classic mechanical mounding significantly increased the degree of decomposition, indicative of lower substrate quality. Mechanical mounding also greatly reduced moss cover and introduced large amounts of bare ground cover. The two newer mounding methods did not result in these changes and were largely comparable to natural peat properties and vegetation communities.

Although graminoid species are often considered as a single plant functional type (PFT) in land-atmosphere models, our understanding of functional variation among graminoid species is limited, particularly in a restoration context. We used a traits-based approach to evaluate graminoid functional variation and to assess whether different graminoid species should be considered a single PFT or multiple types. We tested hypotheses that greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, CH4) would vary due to differences in plant traits among five graminoid species in a restored peatland in central Alberta, Canada. We further hypothesized that species would form two functionally distinct groupings based on taxonomy (grass, sedge). Differences in gas fluxes among species primarily reflected variation in leaf physiology related to photosynthetic efficiency and resource-use, and secondarily by plant size. Multivariate analyses did not reveal distinct functional groupings based on taxonomy or environmental preferences. Rather, we identified functional groups defined by plant traits and carbon fluxes that are consistent with ecological strategies related to differences in growth rate, resource-acquisition and leaf economics, representing plants with either a strategy to grow quickly and invest in resource capture or to prioritize structural investment and resource conservation. These functional groups displayed larger average carbon fluxes compared to graminoid PFTs currently used in modelling. Synthesis. Existing PFT designations in peatland models may be more appropriate for pristine or high-latitude systems than those under restoration. Although replacing PFTs with plant traits remains a challenge in peatlands, traits related to leaf physiology and growth rate strategies offer a promising avenue for future applications.","2022-09","2025-01-09 17:29:49","2025-03-07 22:07:53","","2105-2117","","9","110","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000809175500001","5.5","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the greenhouse gas fluxes from grasses versus sedges in restored peatlands and did not find differences based on this taxonomic difference or by habitat, but did observe differences based on growth rates. </p> </div>","","","Canada; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; greenhouse gases; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; functional types; graminoids; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These wetlands, characterized by woody vegetation cover, encompass a diverse suite of ecosystems, including broad-leaved, needle-leaved, mixedwood or shrub/thicket swamps. Uncertainties in the role of swamps in carbon uptake and release continue to be substantial due to insufficient data on variabilities in carbon densities across diverse swamp types and relatively few flux measurements from swamp sites. Robust measurements of rates of vertical accretion of swamp soils and the associated long-term rates of carbon accumulation, alongside measurements of carbon losses from swamps, are needed for emerging frameworks for carbon accounting, and for assessments of the impacts of climate warming and land use change on this important wetland type. Based on data compilation, we present here a comparative analysis from a series of North American swamp sites on carbon dioxide, methane and dissolved organic carbon fluxes, aboveground biomass, net primary productivity (NPP), and soil carbon properties including bulk densities, organic carbon contents, peat depths, rates of vertical accretion, and rates of long-term carbon accumulation. We compare these properties for four major swamp types: needle-leaved, broad-leaved, mixedwood and shrub/thicket swamps. We show differences in carbon fluxes, biomass and NPP across the four types, with broad-leaved swamps having the largest CH4 flux, highest soil bulk densities, thinnest peat depths and lowest soil organic matter contents, whereas needle-leaved swamps have the smallest CH4 flux, highest aboveground biomass and highest NPP. We show high soil carbon stocks (kg C m(-2)) in all types of swamps, even those where organic deposits were too shallow to meet the definition of peat. However, we note there is a significant lack of studies focused on swamp carbon dynamics despite their abundance across Canada and the United States.","2022-05-01","2025-01-09 17:29:49","2025-03-12 01:56:40","","","","5","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000783683600001","6.7","2","SC: 0000025","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the importance of swamps across North America on greenhouse gas dynamics and carbon storage.</p> </div>","","","Canada; greenhouse gases; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; swamp; carbon storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Restoring the carbon (C) sink function in degraded peatlands and preventing further stored C losses is a key climate mitigation strategy, given the global scale of peatland disturbance. Active restoration involving a combination of rewetting and vegetation reestablishment at a post-extraction peatland in Canada has been shown to successfully re-establish net CO2 uptake rates similar to undisturbed peatlands within a decade or two. However, lower than expected CH4 emissions suggest recovery of belowground C cycling processes may lag behind the recovery of the surface net flux. Using closed chamber measurements over a warm season, we determined that restored Sphagnum, which covers two thirds of the site, was a null source of CH4. Emissions from the restored site were primarily attributed to vascular plant substrate inputs, measured as acetate, and plant-mediated transport. The C isotopic fractionation factor for CH4 and CO2 in the pore water from the restored former peat field suggested reduced hydrogenotrophic CH4 production deeper in the cutover peat profile (0.8 m depth). In contrast, isotopic fractionation in the former drainage ditches showed a balance of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis deeper in the profile, indicative of some bulk peat C turnover. This study suggests that the legacy of substrate quality in the cutover peat can reduce the climate warming impact of newly restored peatlands through a reduction in CH4 production and thus emission.","2021-12","2025-01-09 17:29:49","2025-03-07 22:07:55","","","","12","126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000734472100020","3.7","2","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the amount and origin of methane from post-extracted peatlands following restoration of the peatland using the moss layer transfer technique. &nbsp;</p> </div>","","","Canada; on-site restoration; vegetation; greenhouse gases; substrate disturbance; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; bryophytes; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tree removal and ground disturbance alter vegetation communities and are expected to change ecosystem functioning. As boreal landscapes continue to be disturbed by linear disturbances, understanding the magnitude and mechanisms of vegetation and phenology changes is the first step toward predicting carbon cycling changes across broad spatial scales. We investigate seismic line disturbances on peatland plant community composition and phenological patterns using readily available digital photography at a bog and a fen in Alberta, Canada. Our objectives were to: (a) compare the understory peatland vegetation on seismic lines with those in adjacent undisturbed areas using two phenological metrics (green and red chromatic coordinates); (b) evaluate if vegetation greenness is directly related to vegetation community composition, and (c) determine whether plot-scale greenness predicts plant productivity. We found that areas of peatlands intersected by seismic lines have an earlier seasonal peak (maximum greenness) compared to undisturbed areas, and vegetation communities had a stronger relationship to greenness and gross primary production (GPP) at disturbed areas relative to undisturbed areas. This change in understory vegetation results in greater CO2 uptake in disturbed areas. We demonstrate an easy-to-use application of digital photography that successfully quantifies phenological changes in boreal peatland vegetation. This nondestructive method for understanding vegetation phenology eliminated the need for fixed infrastructure and allowed us to expand our sampling capacity and study sites while allowing for repeated measures in the future.","2021-08","2025-01-09 17:29:49","2025-03-12 18:13:53","","","","8","126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000688734500027","3.7","2","SC: 0000029","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the shift in chromatic signatures of seismic lines.

While their restoration has been shown to increase methane (CH4) flux compared to unrestored sites, the time required for CH4 balance to recover and the factors affecting the recovery remain unclear. We quantified CH4 emissions from restored sites with different time since restoration efforts began (5, 8 and 25 years prior to the study), an unrestored post-extraction (Unrestored) and actively extracted (Active) sites, and compared them to CH4 emission from a natural boreal bog (Natural). All study sites were located within one horticulture peatland complex in central Alberta, Canada. Both steady (diffusive and steady ebullitive) fluxes and abrupt ebullitive events were determined using manual chambers and a portable greenhouse gas analyzer. Methane emissions were greater at the restored sites than at the Natural, Unrestored, and Active sites. Abrupt ebullition occurred only at two restored sites that were flooded/water saturated, dominated by vascular plants, and had the highest steady fluxes. Ebullition accounted for 7% of total CH4 emission at the site restored in 1991 (25-26 years postrestoration), and 6% at the site restored in 2012 (4-5 years post-restoration). Despite shallow water table and dense sedge cover, the third restored site (7-8 years post-restoration), showed no abrupt ebullition and mean steady flux lower than at the Natural site, likely caused by peat geochemistry. At sites where it occurred, ebullition was significantly positively but weakly correlated with CH4 flux, concentration of CH4 in pore water, soil temperature, water table (WT), gross ecosystem production , and percentage cover of moss. Steady CH4 fluxes were higher when soil temperature at 20 cm depth was higher, WT shallow, and with greater plant productivity and cover of graminoids, but lower with higher shrub cover. Peat chemical characteristics can supersede these environmental factors and suppress CH4 emission even in restored, wet, and sedge-dominated sites. Restored sites with more fen-like conditions (wet and sedge-dominated) are likely to have abrupt ebullition events and higher CH4 fluxes than undisturbed bogs, with local controls seemingly more important than time since restoration on resulting CH4 emission.","2021-11-01","2025-01-09 17:29:49","2025-10-02 13:45:35","","","","","169","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000671500900003","3.8","2","SC: 0000010","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the methane flux along a gradient from natural peatlands, extracted peatlands, restored peatlands and unrestored peatlands.

The aim of our study was to investigate the hydrological DOC fluxes into a constructed fen in 2015 and 2016 (2- and 3-years post-construction respectively), relative to internal DOC production, and to assess the potential importance of each source for DOC export using DOC concentration and quality parameters. Our results show that while runoff added a small amount of DOC in both years, DOC concentration within the fen is driven largely by increased vegetation production, with DOC increasing in the years since construction. The measured quality indices (SUVA(254), E2/E3, FI, HIX, and beta/a) all showed that DOC present in the system is likely more recently produced and plant sourced. There was also little evidence that precipitation and runoff inputs from hillslopes impacted the quality of DOC present in the fen, while DOC export from the fen was minimal. As this constructed wetland continues to mature, it is important that monitoring of DOC continues in order to understand the trajectory of biogeochemical dynamics of the system following vegetation establishment, as well as changes under potential future climatic variations.","2021-08","2025-01-09 17:29:49","2025-03-08 14:23:56","","","","","599","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000673486000025","6.4","1","SC: 0000001","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the dissolve organic carbon transport and movement through an experimental constructed fen in the Alberta bituminous sands region. </p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; contaminant transport; carbon cycle; mine reclamation; fen; dissolved organic carbon; mine planning; fertility change/contamination; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important aspect of wetland reclamation is understanding the biogeochemical functioning and carbon exchange, including methane (CH4) emissions, in the developing ecosystem. This study investigates the drivers of CH4 emissions over the first seven years of ecosystem development at a constructed fen in the AOSR and looks towards future CH4 emissions from this site. Specifically, the objectives were to: 1) investigate the environmental controls on CH4 emissions measured using manual static chambers between 2013 and 2019 and 2) investigate the relationship between water table depth, sulfate (SO42-) concentrations and CH4 emissions during the 2019 growing season. Methane emissions remained low throughout the majority of the measurement period; however, in later years, a small but significant increase became apparent. High levels of SO4- are likely the cause of the low CH4 emissions, despite the high-water tables and dominance of vegetation with aerenchyma such as Carex aquatilis and Typha latifolia in later years. Although low CH4 emissions may be beneficial from a climate warming perspective, the results also suggest that this constructed peatland is not functioning similarly to regional reference fens. Future climate scenarios across Western Boreal Canada could lead to higher air temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, influencing the direction of future CH4 emissions from this site. However, given the likelihood of this site maintaining extremely high SO42- concentrations over the next decade, it is expected that CH4 emissions will remain low.","2021-10-01","2025-01-09 17:29:49","2025-03-11 18:45:18","","","","","789","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000677550500019","9.8","1","SC: 0000013","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the greenhouse gas dynamics of a constructed fen peatland for mine reclamation.

In this study two oil sands exploration sites were monitored 6- and 9-years post-treatment, along with two control areas disturbed 20 years ago with no active restoration treatment. Results were compared to a natural reference site to understand how various restoration techniques influenced carbon flux and growing season carbon balance. Tree ingress was observed across all parts of the restored oil sands exploration sites except a wet control area disturbed 20 years ago. The creation of dry microsites through the mechanical mounding technique substantially increased tree productivity, and we found that 9 years post-restoration the mounded area of an oil sands exploration site had a tree net primary productivity similar to the natural site. This carbon uptake, however, was partially offset by large emissions of methane from pools adjacent to mounds. We found that planting trees only could result in a growing season carbon balance that is within the range of a natural peatland 9 years following restoration. However, our estimates indicate that the mounding treatment 9 years following restoration released less carbon to the atmosphere overall compared to all other restoration treatments and control areas. This restoration technique may be useful if the restoration goal is focused on returning the carbon storage function at disturbed sites.

We quantified CH4 fluxes, pore water concentration (PW[CH4]), and production potential together with ecohydrological variables that may influence CH4 dynamics over four growing seasons. Mean (standard deviation) fluxes for open and treed poor fen [99.8 (269.7) and 68.3 (118.8) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1), respectively] were higher than for treed rich [32.8 (63.7) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)] and open SFs [34.6 (91.3) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)]. The total growing season CH4 emissions from these fens ranged between 3.7 and 11.3 g CH4 m(-2). Methane production potential varied from 0.1 (0.1) mu mol CH4 g peat(-1) day(-1) at the SF to 4.6 (0.8) mu mol CH4 g peat(-1) day(-1) at the treed rich fen. The variability of CH4 fluxes and pore water concentration between study sites and years was mostly controlled water table (WT) and soil temperature indicating that these variables should be used to assess the expected CH4 flux in peatland reclamation projects.

We found that using emission factors specific to an active restoration technique resulted in a radiative forcing reduction of 89% within 20 years compared to IPCC Tier 1 emission factors based on a wide range of rewetting activities. Immediate active restoration achieved a neutral climate impact (excluding C losses in the removed peat) about 155 years earlier than did a 20 year delay in restoration. A management plan that includes prompt active restoration is key to utilizing peatland restoration as a climate change mitigation strategy.","2019-12","2025-01-09 17:29:49","2025-03-12 01:42:48","","","","12","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000514833200005","6.7","2","SC: 0000080","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper models the effect of time to restoration of post-extracted peatlands on the greenhouse gas release and climate change impacts.</p> </div>","","","Canada; on-site restoration; greenhouse gases; substrate disturbance; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; mitigation hierarchy; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we investigate the effects of two vascular species used for fen construction on CH4 dynamics.

In columns with J. balticus, evidence to support radial oxygen loss reducing CH4 concentration and production was found. Water sampled from peat columns with constructed fen water had higher Fe (all cation forms), Mn (all cation forms), SO42-, and NO3- compared to columns with rich fen water, which corresponded to lower CH4 emissions and pore water concentration.

This study capitalizes on the rare opportunity of having 3 years of prefire and 3 years of postfire DOC data at a treed, moderate-rich fen in the Western Boreal Plain, northern Alberta, to investigate wildfire effects on peatland DOC dynamics. We investigated whether a wildfire facilitated any changes in the pore water DOC concentration and quality. There was very little impact of the fire directly, with no significant changes in DOC concentrations postfire. We highlight that DOC patterns are more likely to be controlled by local hydrogeological factors than any effect of fire. Fall hydrological conditions and subsequent winter storage processes impose a strong control on DOC concentrations the following year. We suggest that the presence or absence of concrete ground frost in the fen (determined by fall water table position) influences overwinter storage changes, controlling the effect that DOC-poor snowmelt may have on pore water concentrations. However, an increase in SUVA(254) was found 2 years postfire, indicating an increase in aromaticity.

Understanding how carbon exchange and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics are impacted after a wildfire is important, especially as boreal peatlands may be vulnerable to changes in wildfire regime under a rapidly changing climate. However, given this vulnerability, there is very little in the literature on the impact such fires have on methane (CH4) emissions. This study investigated the effect of wildfire on CH4 emissions at a boreal fen near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, that was partially burned by the Horse River Wildfire in 2016. We measured CH4 emissions and environmental variables (20172018) and CH4 production potential (2018) in two different microform types (hummocks and hollows) across a peat burn severity gradient (unburned (UB), moderately burned (MB), and severely burned (SB)). Results indicated a switch in the typical understanding of boreal peatland CH4 emissions. For example, emissions were significantly lower in the MB and SB hollows in both years compared to UB hollows. Interestingly, across the burned sites, hummocks had higher fluxes in 2017 than hollows at the MB and SB sites. We found typically higher emissions at the UB site where the water table was close to the surface. However, at the burned sites, no relationship was found between CH4 emissions and water table, even under similar hydrological conditions. There was also significantly higher CH4 production potential from the UB site than the burned sites. The reduction in CH4 emissions and production in the hollows at burned sites highlights the sensitivity of hollows to fire, removing labile organic material for potential methanogenesis. The previously demonstrated resistance of hummocks to fire also results in limited impact on CH4 emissions and likely faster recovery to pre-fire rates. Given the potential initial net cooling effect resulting from a reduction in CH4 emissions, it is important that the radiative effect of all GHGs following wildfire across peatlands is taken into account.","2019-07-09","2025-01-09 17:29:50","2025-03-07 18:21:17","","2651-2660","","13","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000474651500002","4.9","2","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of microtopographical forms (hummocks vs hollows) on greenhouse gas emissions from a burned peatland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; fire; peatland; greenhouse gases; carbon cycle; microtopography; fen; physiography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a full factorial water table (control, drained 2 years [experimental], drained 12 years [drained]) x warming (ambient, open-top chamber warming) x microform (hummock, hollow) study design, we monitored DOC concentration and spectrophotometric properties (specific ultraviolet absorbance [SUVA], E2/E3, E4/E6) in a wooded boreal bog in Alberta, Canada. Ecohydrological conditions including water table (WT), soil temperature, plant cover, biomass, and productivity were also measured at each plot. We observed a significant interaction between WT treatment, warming and microform for explaining variation in DOC concentrations, with the highest values at drained, warmed hummocks. Overall, drainage resulted in higher DOC concentration. DOC concentration and E2/E3 increased, whereas SUVA decreased, in response to greater plant productivity (i.e., more negative values of gross ecosystem photosynthesis). For DOC concentration and SUVA, this correlation was largely driven by drained, warmed hummocks where shrub growth increased. Moreover, redundancy analysis indicated that shrub and lichen cover, along with WT and soil temperature, were important for explaining variation in DOC concentration and quality. The results indicate that, although DOC concentrations in peatlands are likely to increase under climate change, much of this increase may be from recent carbon fixation, suggesting more rapid carbon cycling as opposed to destabilization of existing carbon stocks.","2019-07","2025-01-09 17:29:50","2025-03-07 18:27:29","","","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000474658500002","2.6","3","SC: 0000022","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of water table drawdown and soil warming on the DOC dynamics in boreal peatlands.

In August 2016, a total of 72 peat samples were collected from twelve 20 m long transects perpendicular to access roads, with a further six samples collected from undisturbed reference areas. Sampling locations represent a range in three variables associated with roads: 1) side of the road (upstream/downstream), 2) distance to a culvert (longitudinal; <2 and >20 m), and 3) distance from the road (lateral; 2, 6, and 20 m). Phenol oxidase and hydrolase (glucosidase, sulfatase, xylosidase, glucosaminidase, and phosphatase) enzyme activities were determined for each sample, in addition to water table depth, phenolic concentration, pH, and peat temperature. The average hydrolase activities in the fen were similar to four times higher than in the bog. At the bog, the water table depth, phenolic concentration, pH and the activities of phenol oxidase, sulfatase, glucosidase, xylosidase and glucosaminidase were all significantly influenced by one or more road associated factors. The highest enzyme activities in the bog occurred on the downstream side of the road at plots located far from the culvert. In contrast, the flow of water in the fen was not perpendicular to the road. Consequently, no significant variations in water table depth, phenolic concentration, pH or enzyme activity were found with respect to road associated factors. Results indicate that road crossings in boreal peatlands can indirectly alter enzyme activities, likely as part of a causal chain following changes to hydrology and redox conditions. Two of six investigated enzymes had significantly higher activities in the road disturbed areas compared to undisturbed areas, suggesting ultimately that roads may enhance organic matter decomposition rates. However, adequate hydrologic connections through culverts and road construction parallel to the water flow can minimize the road-induced impacts. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Gas emissions were compared to nearby undisturbed plots, and plots with restored hydrology but without vegetation transfer. The main drivers for the observed emissions were inferred from the relationships with relevant environmental variables (vegetation cover, water table depth and temperature). Restoration of the extracted minerotrophic fen through the MLTT produced significant changes in the exchange of CO2, bringing these fluxes closer to undisturbed plots than plots with restored hydrology only, which remained C sources throughout the study. Methane emissions were generally low across all the restored plots and far from natural levels, with only a slight increase at the MLTT restored plots observed during the third year. Even though the MLTT failed to recover the original bryophyte-dominated vegetation, the observed changes in the emissions of CO2 and CH4 at the restored plots were strongly associated with changes in vegetation cover (i.e. increase in vascular plants), supporting the use of this restoration technique to recover the C sink function of harvested minerotrophic peatlands.","2018-12-15","2025-01-09 17:29:50","2025-10-02 14:20:28","","149-158","","","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000449554400015","3.8","2","SC: 0000003","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the short term &nbsp;carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas dynamics of a fen peatland after the application of the moss layer transfer technique (MLTT).

Restoration may reduce peat oxidation, but traditional measurements of decomposition are time-consuming. The Tea Bag Index (TBI) is a simple, standardized method to measure decomposition rates in soils. We used the TBI to measure decomposition rate at four restored peatland sites across Canada that were used for peat extraction or disturbed by oil extraction (former well-sites), comparing to undisturbed and unrestored sites. We measured environmental conditions including soil temperature, water table position and peat pH from May to August 2016. Litter bags were buried for one year alongside tea bags at one site for a direct comparison of decomposition rates between the methods. There were no significant differences for TBI decay constant (k(TBI)) between treatments of restored, unrestored or undisturbed sites across the whole data set, but some differences were found among treatments within the same peatland site for sections restored at different times in the past. Soil temperature, pH, and water table were not significantly related to k(TBI), but were negatively correlated with the stabilization factor (S). The k(TBI) and litter bag k were significantly different but positively correlated. The TBI is not easily comparable to traditional litter bags, but is less costly in both time and money, and may be used in conjunction with additional parameters to determine decomposition patterns with potential for use as a metric for evaluating restoration outcomes.","2018","2025-01-09 17:29:50","2025-03-07 18:19:53","","221-235","","","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000458689100015","1.2","4","SC: 0000049","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper evaluates the use of a simple method using tea bags to measure decomposition in restored peatlands as compared to natural peatlands, and consequently the carbon sequestration. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; decomposition; carbon sequestration; monitoring; carbon cycle; mitigation hierarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The WT was lowered at experimental and drained sites to 74 and 120cm, respectively, whereas a warming of similar to 1 degrees C was created at one half of the microforms using open-top chambers.

Peat TIN available and extractable pools increased with deepening of WT and over time and were greater at hummocks relative to hollows. In contrast, the PO4 pools increased with short-term drainage but reverted to very close to their original (control) nutrient values in the longer term. The WT and warming driven change in the peat TIN pool was strongly reflected in the vascular vegetation C:N ratio and shrub C-13 and N-15, whereas moss nutrient dynamics did not vary between sites. Therefore, we suggest that atmospheric warming combined with WT deepening can increase availability of mineral N and P, which then can be reflected in vascular vegetation and hence modify the productivity and ecosystem functioning of the northern midlatitude continental wooded bogs in the long term.","2017-12","2025-01-09 17:29:50","2025-03-07 18:27:49","","","","8","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000417099800008","2.6","3","SC: 0000054","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of water table drawdown and soil warming on nutrient availability in a forested bog in western Canada. </p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; bog; soil temperature; soil warming; nutrients; substrate disturbance; drawdown; climate; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we present a novel workflow for mapping groundwater using orthophotography and photogrammetric point clouds acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that pockets of surface water are normally abundant in peatlands, which we assume to be reflective of GWL in these porous, gently sloping environments. By first classifying surface water and then extracting a sample of water elevations, we can generate continuous models of GWL through interpolation. Estimates of DTW can then be obtained through additional efforts to characterize terrain. We demonstrate our methodology across a complex, 61-ha treed bog in northern Alberta, Canada.

These fluxes were compared to those measured at sites within the same bog where water-table (WT) was drawn down for 2 and 12 years. Experimental WT drawdown significantly increased R-FF with greater increases at hummocks than hollows. Greater R-FF was largely driven by increased autotrophic respiration driven by increased growth of trees and shrubs in response to drier conditions; heterotrophic respiration accounted for a declining proportion of R-FF with time since drainage. Heterotrophic respiration was increased at hollows, suggesting that soil carbon may be lost from these sites in response to climate change induced drying.

Using a fen constructed in the post-mining landscape of the Athabasca oil sands region, a study was conducted to quantify the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) during the peak growing seasons over the first two years following revegetation. The specific objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of revegetation strategies and other environmental characteristics on the fen GHG emissions over the growing season. Relative to a natural fen, our results show significantly lower fluxes of CH4 (p < 0.001), which correlate with higher bulk density, lower organic matter content, and higher pH and SO42- concentration in the constructed fen. Revegetation did not stimulate CH4 production, but increased CO2 uptake and reduced N2O emissions relative to the non-vegetated control. These results suggest that revegetation strategies and water chemistry might be more important controls on GHG fluxes than substrate quality in a constructed fen. Although the current edaphic conditions in the constructed fen support the potential for a net uptake of GHGs over the growing season, additional monitoring is required to evaluate if these conditions will persist in the long-term. We recommend that future reclamation projects should consider the potential effects of construction materials on water chemistry prior to use in fen reclamation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previous work suggested that limited connectivity between surficial layers and the underlying partially decomposed plant matter and peat would result in water stress and inhibited growth. This study links the soil water dynamics of regenerated layers ranging in age from 3 to 43 years and from 3 to 40 cm in thickness to the productivity of Sphagnum in order to determine the hydrological controls on productivity and the optimal range of water content for producing Sphagnum biomass. Productivity was never observed to be limited by insufficient supply of water, including during periods where water table was >40 cm below the surface and periods of 16 days without measured precipitation. While layers of different ages and thicknesses were able to sustain adequate water supply to remain productive under a range of conditions, the ability of layers to transmit water upwards differed greatly. Water content in the near-surface inhibited productivity during wetter periods, especially at newly regenerating sites where the layer was <5 cm thick. This has important implications for biomass production using the Sphagnum species studied here. Using a mixed linear modelling approach to isolate the effects of water content on variance in productivity from those of other measured variables, a volumetric water content of 0.10 is identified as optimal.

This study considers the composition of this 'waterborne carbon' flux, its potential contribution to GHG emissions, and the extent to which it may change in response to land-management. The work describes, and builds on, a methodology to account for major components of these emissions developed for the 2013 Wetland Supplement of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We identify two major components of GHG emissions from waterbodies draining organic soil: i) 'on site' emissions of methane (and to a lesser extent CO2) from drainage ditches located within the peatland; and ii) 'off site' emissions of CO2 resulting from downstream oxidation of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) within the aquatic system. Methane emissions from ditches were found to be large in many cases (mean 60 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1) based on all reported values), countering the view that methane emissions cease following wetland drainage. Emissions were greatest from ditches in intensive agricultural peatlands, but data were sparse and showed high variability. For DOC, the magnitude of the natural flux varied strongly with latitude, from 5 g C m(-2) year(-1) in northern boreal peatlands to 60 g C m(-2) year(-1) in tropical peatlands. Available data suggest that DOC fluxes increase by around 60 % following drainage, and that this increase may be reversed in the longer-term through re-wetting, although variability between studies was high, especially in relation to re-wetting response. Evidence regarding the fate of DOC is complex and inconclusive, but overall suggests that the majority of DOC exported from peatlands is converted to CO2 through photo- and/or bio-degradation in rivers, standing waters and oceans. The contribution of POC export to GHG emissions is even more uncertain, but we estimate that over half of exported POC may eventually be converted to CO2. Although POC fluxes are normally small, they can become very large when bare peat surfaces are exposed to fluvial erosion. Overall, we estimate that waterborne carbon emissions may contribute about 1-4 t CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1) of additional GHG emissions from drained peatlands. For a number of worked examples this represented around 15-50 % of total GHG emissions.","2016-07","2025-01-09 17:29:50","2025-03-07 18:19:57","","573-590","","3","78","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000377360200012","2.4","3","SC: 0000165","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the impact of dissolved organic carbon on the greenhouse gas balance in peatlands impacted by water table drawdown as well as following rewetting. </p> </div>","","","Canada; climate change; hydrology; on-site restoration; greenhouse gases; substrate disturbance; water table; drawdown; rewetting; carbon cycle; erosion; dissolved organic carbon; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To understand how wetland systems may respond to disturbance and set targets for reclamation efforts, it is necessary to understand natural variability in nutrient dynamics in the landscape. The purpose of this study was to characterize spatial variability in peatland nutrient (nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P) dynamics in the Athabasca Oil Sands (AOS) region. N and P availability and net mineralization rates in the upper 10cm layer of peat were examined during the peak growing season in five peatlands that fell along an apparent moisture gradient. N and P dynamics within and among the sites were related to water table position, peat moisture content and temperature. Phosphorus supply rates and total inorganic N pools and supply rates were generally elevated under wetter conditions, whereas nitrate (NO3-) pools and supply rates and P pools did not vary along a moisture gradient. In general, net immobilization was observed at the wetter sites where nutrient pools were elevated and net mineralization was observed at drier sites where nutrient pools were lower. Nutrient transformation rates were most strongly driven by warmer temperatures. Nutrient availability and immobilization rates were anomalously high at one peatland (a disturbed fen with a semi-permanent road and decommissioned well pads). We suggest that reclamation and management practices should focus on regulating peatland hydrologic conditions, optimizing these for the most desirable nutrient levels for vegetation growth.","2016-06","2025-01-09 17:29:50","2025-03-22 16:58:24","","688-699","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000378550200011","2.6","3","SC: 0000053","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper characterizes the variability in nutrient dynamics in peatlands in the Alberta oil sands region as targets for peatland restoration.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; on-site restoration; bog; nutrients; nutrient enrichment; fen; mitigation hierarchy; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the recovery of nutrient cycling processes were assessed from both above and below-ground perspectives in a fen constructed on a post-mining landscape in the Athabasca oil sands region, Canada. The goal of this study was to understand if and how different revegetation strategies (seedlings (SDL); moss layer transfers (MLT); seedlings with moss transfer (SMLT) and a control treatment (CTRL)) influence the evolution of biogeochemical functions in the constructed fen relative to a natural reference (REF). The treatments were replicated 6 times and monitored over 2 growing seasons. Our results showed that revegetation facilitated both above-ground productivity and the cycling of below-ground nutrients, especially in the species-rich SMLT plots. Supply of labile substrates in the re-vegetated plots increased microbial potential activity. This was reflected in higher rates of respiration (c.7.8 g CO2 m(-2) day(-2)), nutrient acquisition (net immobilization) and productivity (c. -16.3 g CO2 m(-2) day(-2)) among revegetated plots relative to the CTRL. Nutrient dynamics within the constructed fen suggest that phosphorus limitation (N:P ratio > 20) could hamper the establishment of a diverse plant community, whereas the build-up of microbial biomass appears to be NO3 limited. Our results also emphasize the need to track the evolution of nutrients cycling processes through long-term monitoring programs, and identify the potential use of ammonification, nitrogen mineralization and phosphorus availability as functional indicators of a fen's recovery trajectory towards conditions present in natural fens.","2016-02","2025-01-09 17:29:50","2025-03-11 18:43:58","","177-194","","","98","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000365998100020","4.8","2","SC: 0000029","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the nutrient cycling dynamics of an experimental fen constructed for mine reclamation in the Alberta oil sands. </p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; mining; nutrients; substrate disturbance; active restoration; mine reclamation; ecosystem conversion; fen; mitigation hierarchy; mine planning; revegetation; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes during the growing season in a restored, cutover peatland in northern Alberta (Boreal Plain Ecozone) and compared these to fluxes measured on a neighboring unrestored area. Restoration resulted in a shift in mean growing season fluxes from 378g CO2C and 0.2g CH4-C at the unrestored site to 30g CO2-C and 3.7g CH4-C at the restored site, where positive values indicate flux of carbon from the peatland to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide exchange was correlated to vascular vegetation cover that varied depending on local water table position. Water table was also related to CH4 flux, with higher emissions from wet sites.

However, peat extraction in fen peatlands or exposure of deeper minerotrophic peat layers results in soil chemistry that is less suitable for re-establishment of Sphagnum moss. In this situation, restoration of plant species characteristic of minerotrophic peatlands is desirable to return the site to a carbon accumulating system. In these cases, it may be worthwhile to maintain spontaneously revegetating species as part of restoration if they provide desirable ecosystem functions. We studied the role of six spontaneously recolonizing vegetation communities for methane (CH4) emissions and pore water CH4 concentration for two growing seasons (2008 and 2009) at an abandoned minerotrophic peatland in southeastern Quebec. We then compared the results with bare peat and adjacent natural fen vegetation. Communities dominated by Eriophorum vaginatum, Carex aquatilis and Typha latifolia had CH4 flux an order of magnitude greater than other cutover vegetation types and natural sites. In contrast, Scirpus atrocinctus and Equisetum arvense had CH4 emission rates lower than natural hollow vegetation. We found seasonal average water table and vegetation volume had significant correlation with CH4 flux. Water table and soil temperature were significantly correlated with CH4 flux at plots where the water table was near or above the surface. Pore water CH4 concentration suggests that CH4 is being produced at the cutover peatland and that low measured fluxes likely result from substantial oxidation of CH4 in the unsaturated zone. Understanding ecosystem functions of spontaneously recolonizing species on cutover fens can be used to help make decisions about the inclusion of these communities for future restoration measures.","2011-11","2025-01-09 17:29:50","2025-03-07 18:21:18","","1859-1868","","11","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000295303500030","3.8","2","SC: 0000060","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the methane dynamics of restoring fens in post-extraction peatlands in southern Québec. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; vegetation; greenhouse gases; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; fen; vegetation disturbance; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study provides a carbon emissions analysis comparing the traditional vacuum harvest (VH) and block-cut (BC) extraction techniques to a new acrotelm transplant (AT) method that restores natural peatland function by preserving and replacing the surface layer vegetation as part of the extraction process. The relative global warming potential for each extraction method was determined by estimating carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane exchange for each phase of peat extraction, including emissions from land-use change and machinery fuel consumption. Preliminary findings, based on 1 y of measurements, indicate that the AT technique has the lowest annual carbon emissions compared to the VH and BC methods. Projected total carbon emissions from a 75-ha peatland after 50 y of extraction using the AT technique produced a sink of approximately 3300 t CO(2) equivalents (CO(2)-e). This represents a marked reduction in total carbon emissions estimated for the VH (19 000 t CO(2)-e) and BC (29 000 t CO(2)-e) extraction techniques. This analysis suggests that the AT method reestablishes peat accumulation and peatland carbon storage function more effectively than the VH and BC methods, which are associated with delayed restoration efforts. Consequently, the AT technique has the potential to greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the Canadian horticultural peat industry.","2009-06","2025-01-09 17:29:50","2025-03-12 01:42:48","","194-200","","4","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000267410900003","6.5","2","SC: 0000040","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper compares the carbon footprints of vcuum-extraction or block-exraction of peat as compared to a new ‘acrotelm transplant’ technique (AT) that removes the peat just below the peatland vegetation surface.

Potential toxicity problems from the discharge of Al, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, As, Hg, and CN into the mine’s industrial treatment wetland were assessed by an examination of sediment/soil and uptake of these contaminants into vegetation. In total, five study sites were established along the entrance of wetland to the receiving environment. Two of the study sites were positioned within the treatment wetland and a final site in the receiving environment each with corresponding control sites. The treatment wetland was proven to reduced the loadings of Cu, Ni, As and Al by absorption into the sediment or uptake by plants. Concentrations of Fe, Mn and Zn were released by the wetland and were slightly elevated in the discharge water. The release of heavy metals from acid mine drainage from the tailings area of the closed Dona Lake Mine (5 C42' N 90°6' W) was examined in the second part of the study. Potential toxicity due to the release of Al, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, As, Hg, and CN from the mine’s tailings was assessed by an examination of sediment/soil sorption and uptake by vegetation. Four sites were established extending from the tailings impoundment to the receiving environment. Heavy metals released from acid mine drainage caused corresponding elevated metal concentrations in the sediment/soil present at the Dona Lake Mine. Total metal levels in the plant tissue were not elevated when all species were considered simultaneously at the various sites, but increases in metal concentrations in plant tissue did occur when only Typha latifolia was considered. Reclamation of gold mine tailings waste through the development of wetland vegetation covers to determine the control of heavy metal release was examined in the third part of the study. Using a microcosm approach, the potential toxicity of the release of Al, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, As, Hg, CN and SO4 from the mine’s tailings was assessed through an examination of changes in water and sediment/soil concentrations of these compounds, and uptake by vegetation. Four treatments were used consisting of: 1) a control treatment that consisted only of the tailings and water with no added vegetation, 2) a tailings only treatment with added vegetation, 3) a fertilized tailings treatment which included the addition of fertilizer pellets and vegetation and 4) an organic fertilized treatment (15 cm cap of organic soil plus fertilizer pellets) and vegetation. The ability of the vegetative cover to reduce concentrations of contaminants in the water column was most successful in the organic plus fertilizer treatment.

Regionally, these ecosystems provide essential wildfire resilience and are important pollutant sinks but degradation puts these key ecosystem services at risk. Smelting operations in Sudbury, ON, Canada, released approximately 12 000 t of particulate copper and nickel into the atmosphere between 1883 and 1969. Toxic metal and sulphur deposition on peatlands from smelting activities caused the widespread decline of keystone peatland moss species (i.e., Sphagnum) and altered peat properties. The changes in peat hydrophysical properties due to historical metal contamination likely reduce peatland resilience to drought and wildfires, thereby increasing the potential for toxic heavy metal remobilisation; however, these peat properties changes have yet to be quantified. We determine 1) how historical smelter pollution impacts peat hydrophysical properties by measuring bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention in the upper 40 cm of both undisturbed (located similar to 160 km outside the deposition region) and smelter-impacted peatlands, 2) use these data to explore the vulnerability of these peatlands to wildfires and drought and 3) assess the potential for natural Sphagnum moss recovery. Smelter-impacted peat had a significantly higher bulk density, lower macroporosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity that drove large differences in modelled soil water tension profiles during simulated drying events. These differences in soil water tension and retention profiles resulted in the smelter-impacted peat having a far greater proportion of the peat profile that would be susceptible to smouldering combustion than the undisturbed peat. Additionally, the smelter-impacted peat properties likely contributed to the limited Sphagnum moss recovery, while concurrently increasing drought and wildfire risk. As such, we argue that contaminated peatland restoration is necessary to enhance Sphagnum moss recovery to mitigate toxic metal remobilisation risk from drought and wildfire.","2024-12","2025-01-09 19:01:48","2025-03-07 18:20:55","","","","12","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001383065700001","3.2","3","SC: 0000000","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the hydrophysical properties of peat in peatlands near a base-metal smelter in Sudbury and discusses the consequent risks of fire and drought-induced drawdown on metal re-release and on the prospects of sphagnum restoration.</p> </div>","","","climate change; cumulative effects; fire; on-site restoration; vegetation; mineral processing; drawdown; pollution; air pollution; bryophytes; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; metal/metalloid; fertility change/contamination; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some of these important ecosystems are located near heavy metal emitting smelters. To improve the understanding of smelter impacts and potential recovery after initial pollution controls in the 1970s (roughly 50 years of potential recovery), we sampled peatlands along a distance gradient of 134 km from a smelter in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, an area with over a century of nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu) mining activity. This work is aimed at evaluating potential shifts in bacterial and archaeal community structures in Sphagnum moss and its underlying peat within smelter-impacted poor fens. In peat, total Ni and Cu concentrations were higher (0.062-0.067 and 0.110-0.208 mg/g, respectively) at sites close to the smelter and exponentially dropped with distance from the smelter. This exponential decrease in Ni concentrations was also observed in Sphagnum. 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing showed that peat and Sphagnum moss host distinct microbiomes with peat accommodating a more diverse community structure. The microbiomes of Sphagnum were dominated by Proteobacteria (62.5%), followed by Acidobacteria (11.9%), with no observable trends with distance from the smelter. Dominance of Acidobacteria (32.4%) and Proteobacteria (29.6%) in peat was reported across all sites. No drift in taxonomy was seen across the distance gradient or from the reference sites, suggesting a potential microbiome recovery toward that of the reference peatlands microbiomes after decades of pollution controls.

In the laboratory, we determined C, N and H contents in their tissues and obtained the ATR-FTIR spectra (to identify the presence of functional groups). We also conducted surface acid-base titrations and metal adsorption assays with Cd, Cu and Pb. In the field, we exposed transplants of each species near different air-polluting industries, and determined the mosses enrichment of Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and V. Laboratory results demonstrated higher metal uptake capacity in the terrestrial mosses Sphagnum palustre and Pseudoscleropodium purum, compared to that in the aquatic moss Fontinalis antipyretica, which can be attributed to a greater abundance of acidic functional groups (i. e. negatively charged binding sites) on the surface of the terrestrial mosses. The affinity of moss for certain elements depends on the abundance and nature of surface functional groups. Accordingly, the metal concentrations generally reached higher levels in S. palustre transplants compared to the other species, except for the uptake of Hg, which was higher in F. antipyretica. However, the findings also suggest an interaction between the type of environment (terrestrial or aquatic) and the moss characteristics that may influence the abovementioned trend. Thus, irrespective of the physico-chemical characteristics, metal uptake varied depending on the environment of origin of the mosses ""i.e. atmospheric or aquatic"". In other words, the findings suggest that species that accumulate more metals in terrestrial environments will accumulate lower amounts of metals in aquatic environments and vice versa.","2023-09-15","2025-01-09 19:01:48","2025-03-12 01:56:40","","","","","333","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001037284700001","8.9","2","SC: 0000007","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of terrestrial versus aquatic mosses as biomonitor tools for monitoring metals in air pollution.</p> </div>","","","vegetation; monitoring; bryophytes; sphagnum; biomonitoring; metal/metalloid; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we evaluate how the loss of Sphagnum in peatlands close to a copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) smelter in Sudbury, Ontario affected C accumulation and metal profiles. The depth of accumulated peat formed during the 100+ year period of smelter activities also increased with distance from the smelter. Concurrently, peat bulk density decreased with distance from the smelter, which resulted in relatively similar average rates of apparent C accumulation (32-46 g/m2/yr). These rates are within the range of published values despite the historically high pollution loadings. Surface peat close to the smelters was greatly enriched in Cu and Ni, and Cu profiles in dated peat cores generally coincide with known pollution histories much better than Ni that increased well before the beginning of smelter activities likely a result of postdeposition mobility in peat cores.","2023-03-01","2025-01-09 19:01:48","2025-03-07 22:07:10","","","","","320","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000924169700001","8.9","2","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the impact of severe metal pollution from metal smelting on vegetation, greenhouse gas sequestration in impacted peatlands.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; vegetation; mineral processing; carbon sequestration; pollution; carbon cycle; air pollution; bryophytes; sphagnum; copper; metal/metalloid; nickel; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we tried to improve the significance of the moss-bulk deposition (BD) relationship by eliminating the mismatch between the time that the moss tissue selected for analysis is exposed to atmospheric deposition, and the time during which BD is collected. For this, we analysed the concentrations of Cd, Hg and Pb in new grown tissue of Pseudoscleropodium purum and BD collected monthly, for one year, in 21 sampling sites (SS) under different degrees of pollution. Additionally, we assessed how different moss tissues, including native moss (green parts and new grown tissues of P. purum) and moss transplants of Sphagnum deruiculatum, reflect BD to find out which moss tissues provide a better estimate of the atmospheric deposition of heavy metals. First of all, our results showed that eliminating the mismatch between native moss exposure time and BD collection period is not enough to improve their correlation. Environmental variation emerged as the main driver of tissue content variation altering the moss-BD relationship unpredictably. Secondly, native P. purum represents BD values better than devitalized transplants by displaying a greater number of significant correlations with BD. Specifically, green parts of P. purum generally represent better BD than new grown tissues. Overall, we conclude that neither native mosses nor transplants are good estimators of atmospheric heavy metal deposition rates. However, they are good qualitative indicators of the atmospheric deposition, by allowing us to differentiate SS subject to a wide range of pollution levels. Additionally, green parts of P. purum, and likely of other mosses with similar growth forms, should be used in passive biomonitoring studies to make results from different studies comparable.

The mineralogical and chemical composition of soil, snow aerosols, and Sphagnum fallax moss bags all corresponded to the metallogeny of the research area and the ore specialisation of the enterprise (Ni, Cu, Co, and V). Solid aerosols consisted of rock-forming and accessory minerals as well as technogenic formations (slag particles and aggregates composed of Ni-Fe-Co +/- Cu). The concentration of metals in soils, aerosols, snow water, and pine bark significantly exceeded their background values. The reconstruction of new technologies in the Severonickel smelter and recent reduction in emissions did not significantly improve the state of the different landscape components. The calculation of dust, metal, and ionic loads from snow surveys and moss bags showed comparable results. Technogenic emissions were higher in summer due to the increase in atmospheric dust. The low pH of soils and snow water reflected the geochemical conditions of the landscape and increased metal mobility in the environment. The high total content of Ni, Cu, and Co and their mobile forms in soils contributed to the high accumulation of metals in pine bark; this method can therefore be used as an accurate indicator of environmental degradation.","2020-01","2025-01-09 19:01:49","2025-03-12 01:56:42","","76-88","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000701775600001","4.5","3","SC: 0000025","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper compares multiple biomonitoring methods to monitor metals in the arctic environment around metal mines in Russia.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; vegetation; mining; mineral processing; monitoring; pollution; air pollution; bryophytes; sphagnum; fugitive dust; biomonitoring; copper; metal/metalloid; nickel; cobalt; cold climate; snowpack; climate; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper describes a tested and implemented long-term biomonitoring system for airborne heavy metals at a national scale. Moss bags (Hylocomium splendens) were exposed in 142 monitoring stations designated in Romania, and the content of Pb, Cd, Ni and As was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results revealed that the accumulation of heavy metals exceeded the established thresholds, marking high pollution levels in 8.8% of samples for As, in 5.63% samples for Cd, in 3.17% samples for Pb, and in 0.35% samples for Ni. The maximum heavy metal concentration was 113.77 mg kg(-1) dry weight for Pb, 44.93 mg kg(-1) dry weight for Ni, 14.68 mg kg(-1) dry weight for As, and 3.88 mg kg(-1) dry weight for Cd, with several overlaps for at least two metals, thus marking pollution hotspots. In order to process, summarise and communicate the obtained data, a software named BioMonRo has been developed as the core part of a complex monitoring and warning-informative system. The software is able to generate heavy metal pollution maps and specific reports, depicting the levels and patterns of distribution, which can be automatically sent to a number of interested recipients. The results show that the developed national system is functional, cost-effective, and could be successfully used for long-term monitoring of airborne heavy metals.","2019-10-15","2025-01-09 19:01:49","2025-03-12 01:56:44","","","","","248","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000485210300011","8.7","1","SC: 0000036","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of bryophyte bags to biomonitor trace metal and metalloid air pollution in Romania.

Surfaces of Sphagnum carpets were marked with plastic mesh and, one year later, plant matter was harvested and productivity determined. Major and trace element concentrations (Ag, Al, As, Ba, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pb, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sr, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, Zn) were determined in acid digests using sector field ICP-MS. Up to 12 samples (40 x 40 cm) were collected per site, and 6-10 sites investigated per bog. Variation in element accumulation rates within a bog is mostly the result of the annual production rate of the Sphagnum mosses which masks not only the impact of site effects, such as microtopography and the presence of dwarf trees, but also local and regional conditions, including land use in the surrounding area, topography, etc. The difference in productivity between peat bogs results in distinctly higher element accumulation rates at the NBF bogs compared to those from OB for all studied elements. The comparison with the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program (EMEP; wet-only and total deposition) and Modelling of Air Pollutants and Ecosystem Impact (MAPESI; total deposition) data shows that accumulation rates obtained using Sphagnum are in the same range of published values for direct measurements of atmospheric deposition of As, Cd, Cu, Co, Pb, and V in both regions. The accordance is very dependent on how atmospheric deposition rates were obtained, as different models to calculate the deposition rates may yield different fluxes even for the same region. In future studies of atmospheric deposition of trace metals, both Sphagnum moss and deposition collectors have to be used on the same peat bog and results compared. Antimony, however, shows considerable discrepancy, because it is either under-estimated by Sphagnum moss or over-estimated by both atmospheric deposition models. Atmospheric deposition data obtained from sampling in open fields is unlikely to always perfectly match data obtained using living Sphagnum moss from bogs. In fact, plant uptake and biochemical utilization by living moss may affect accumulation rates of those elements that are essential for plant nutrition (macro and micronutrients), which is clearly seen in the data presented here for Mn, Fe and Zn. Furthermore, Sphagnum moss is a unique receptor, with its characteristic roughness and chemical complexity. These two aspects, combined with conditions found on the bog surface (variations in microtopography, shrubs, trees, wetness, snow cover, etc.), result in a unique type of interception and retention. Despite all these factors, the comparison with modelled data shows that Sphagnum moss is a good indicator of atmospheric deposition at least in a semi-quantitative manner and certainly reflects inputs to terrestrial ecosystems.","2017-10","2025-01-09 19:01:49","2025-03-07 22:06:55","","656-664","","","167","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000412612200056","5","2","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of bags of sphagnum moss to biomonitor metal deposition in Germany.

This study examined peat cores sampled from 14 peatlands in the Sudbury region of Ontario, Canada, which has a well-documented history of acid and metal deposition. Copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) concentrations within individual peat cores were strongly correlated and were elevated in the upper 10 cm, especially in the sites closest to the main Copper Cliff smelter. In contrast, nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) concentrations were often elevated at depths greater than 10 cm, indicating much greater post-depositional movement of these metals compared with Cu and Pb. Post-depositional movement of metals is supported by the observation that Ni and Co concentrations in peat pore water increased by approximately 530 and 960% for Ni and Co, respectively between spring and summer due to drought-induced acidification, but there was much less change in Cu concentration. Sphagnum cover and Pb-210 activity measured at 10 cm at the 14 sites significantly increased with distance from Copper Cliff, and the surface peat von Post score decreased with distance from Copper Cliff, indicating the rate of peat formation increases with distance from Sudbury presumably as a result of improved Sphagnum survival. This study shows that the ability of peat to preserve deposition histories of some metals is strongly affected by drought-induced post-depositional movement and that loss of Sphagnum due to air pollution impairs the rate of peat formation, further affecting metal profiles in peatlands.","2016-01-15","2025-01-09 19:01:49","2025-03-12 01:55:15","","1031-1040","","","541","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000365289300107","9.8","1","SC: 0000019","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the impacts of drought and air pollution on metals in peatlands subject to historic air pollution near Ni-Cu smelters in Sudbury, Ontario.</p> </div>","","","peatland; vegetation; mineral processing; carbon sequestration; drawdown; pollution; carbon cycle; air pollution; bryophytes; sphagnum; metal/metalloid; nickel; cobalt; peat/sediment cores; fertility change/contamination; hydrological alteration; drought","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The adsorption of Cu2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+ onto Hypnum sp., Sphagnum sp., Pseudoscleropodium purum and Brachytecium rutabulum has been investigated using a batch reactor in a wide range of pH (1.3-11.0) and metal concentrations in solution (1.6 mu M-3.8 mM). A Linear Programming Model (LPM) was applied for the experimental data to derive equilibrium constants and the number of surface binding sites. The surface acid-base titration performed for 4 mosses at a pH range of 3-10 in 0.1 M NaNO3 demonstrated that Sphagnum sp. is the most efficient adsorbent as it has the maximal number of proton-binding sites on the surface (0.65 mmol g(-1)). The pK(a) computed for all the moss species suggested the presence of 5 major functional groups: phosphodiester, carboxyl, phosphoryl, amine and polyphenols. The results of pH-edge experiments demonstrated that B. rutabulum exhibits the highest percentage of metal adsorption and has the highest number of available sites for most of the metals studied. However, according to the results of the constant pH ""Langmuirian"" isotherm, Sphagnum sp. can be considered as the strongest adsorbent, although the relative difference from other mosses is within 20%. The LPM was found to satisfactorily fit the experimental data in the full range of the studied solution parameters. The results of this study demonstrate a rather similar pattern of five metal adsorptions on mosses, both as a function of pH and as a metal concentration, which is further corroborated by similar values of adsorption constants. Therefore, despite the species and geographic differences between the mosses, a universal adsorption edge and constant pH adsorption isotherm can be recommended for 4 studied mosses. The quantitative comparison of metal adsorption with other common natural organic and inorganic materials demonstrates that mosses are among the most efficient natural adsorbents of heavy metals.

Much of this focus on the peat record has been on biological proxies of environmental change, such as pollen and peat-forming macrofossils, but there is growing interest in the geochemical record to study environmental changes. Several studies of long-term peat records in Europe have reconstructed past changes in atmospheric lead pollution, for example, and the general cohesiveness of the results and their agreement with known historical trends in metal production exemplify the best potential of peat geochemistry as an environmental archive. Based on the success with lead, a current emphasis in peat reconstructions is to assess the record of past mercury deposition and results thus far show generally consistent trends, e.g., a pre-anthropogenic mercury accumulation rate of about 0.5-1.5 mu g Hg m(-2) year(-1). Despite this general consistency there is increasing concern that there may be diagenetic effects on the quantitative record of some metals, which can be inferred based on a strong relationship between mercury and other organically bound elements and proxies for peat decomposition (C/N ratio). However, it is possible that changes in decomposition and the alteration of some metal records could provide climatic information. A few recent studies show that closer examination of the geochemical matrix, in some cases along with biological proxies, can provide valuable information on landscape changes and climate; for example, partitioning metals into different weight fractions and source regions can be applied to climate studies. The best interpretations of the peat geochemical record in the context of environmental and climate change will likely come when geochemical and biological records are considered simultaneously.","2006-10","2025-01-09 19:01:50","2025-03-07 22:07:11","","209-221","","4","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000241505700001","3.9","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of peat cores from peatlands to follow historical changes in anthropogenic metal pollution, specifically lead and mercury.

It can be treated in situ by sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB), but effectiveness of the treatment process depends on the organic substrate chosen to supply the bacteria's carbon source. Six natural organic materials were characterized in order to investigate how well these promote sulphate reduction and metal precipitation by SRB. Maple wood chips, sphagnum peat moss, leaf compost, conifer compost, poultry manure and conifer sawdust were investigated in terms of their carbon (TOC, TIC, DOC) and nitrogen (TKN) content, as well as their easily available substances content (EAS). Single substrates, ethanol, a mixture of leaf compost (30% w/w), poultry manure (18% w/w), and maple wood chips (2% w/w), and the same mixture spiked with formaldehyde were then tested in a 70-day batch experiment to evaluate their performance in sulphate reduction and metal removal from synthetic AMD. Metal removal efficiency in batch reactors was as high as 100% for Fe, 99% for Mn, 99% for Cd, 99% for Ni, and 94% for Zn depending on reactive mixtures. Early metal removal (0-12 d) was attributed to the precipitation of (oxy)hydroxides and carbonate minerals. The lowest metal and sulphate removal efficiency was found in the reactor containing poultry manure as the single carbon source despite its high DOC and EAS content. The mixture of organic materials was most effective in promoting sulphate reduction, followed by ethanol and maple wood chips, and single natural organic substrates generally showed low reactivity. Formaldehyde (0.015% (w/v)) provided only temporary bacterial inhibition. Although characterization of substrates on an individual basis provided insight on their chemical make-up, it did not give a clear indication of their ability to promote sulphate reduction and metal removal.

However, the adsorption potential of peat can be expected to be strongly dependent on the chemical properties of the water. In this study, the effect of pH, ionic strength (CaCl2 and NaCl concentrations), and metal concentration on Cu and Zn adsorption onto poorly humified Sphagnum and Carex peat was investigated in batch experiments using a fractional factorial experimental design. The pH value was varied between 4 and 8, the CaCl2 and NaCl concentrations between 1.2-6.2 and 0.4-43 mM, respectively, and the Cu and Zn concentrations between 0.05 and 0.5 mM. The amount of Zn adsorbed increased more with increasing pH than the amount of Cu adsorbed. The effect of NaCl/CaCl2 concentration was minor. It was found that Zn adsorption in particular, but also Cu adsorption, increased more with pH onto Carex peat than onto Sphagnum peat. In the pH interval 4-8, the removal of Zn from the solution increased from 0% to 80% using Carex peat and from 10% to 65% using Sphagnum peat as the adsorbent. The Carex peat sample decreased the Cu concentration by 80% at pH 4 and by 95% at pH 8 and for Sphagnum peat a decrease of 85% was maintained in the pH range investigated. The differences between Sphagnum and Carex peat were attributed to the habitat conditions at the time of peat formation. Carex peat has higher ash, nitrogen and sulphur concentrations, while Sphagnum peat contains a higher amount of uronic acid. In treating polluted waters with peat, a higher degree of metal removal can be expected at high pH values than at low.

We examined rates of CH4 production in peat from five geographically and functionally disparate Sphagnum-dominated peatlands by incubating peat samples in vitro with and without additions of trace metals (Fe, Ni, Co) and base cations (Ca, Li, Na). In peat from the most mineral poor sites, the addition of metals and Na enhanced CH4 production beyond that observed in controls.

Measurements of Cu, Pb, and Zn in peat hummocks sampled within a 75-km radius of the smelter at Rouyn-Noranda in northwestern Quebec show a pattern of high values close to the smelter, decaying to a background level some 50-100 km away. Assuming a constant bulk density of peat and accumulation rate of the peat hummock surface, a model fitted to metal concentration data allows the rate of metal deposition to be calculated as a function of distance from the smelter. After subtracting background (assumed to be constant), integration of the model from the smelter to more than 200 km away yielded estimates of the tonnages of smelter-derived metals for the sampling year (1997) as follows: Cu-14 tonnes, Pb-20 tonnes and Zn-17 tonnes. These amounts represent 29%, 10%, and 30% of the metal emissions reported from the smelter for 1997. The ""missing"" metal was either incompletely trapped by the Sphagnum moss, or carried farther away by long-distance atmospheric transport. This paper examines the effects of errors from various sources to understand better the uncertainties in the tonnage estimates. The sources of error (at least those that are tractable) affecting the metal tonnage estimates are: (1) precision of the analyses (laboratory sample splits include both analytical error and within-sample variation); (2) error associated with the degree of fit of the model to the data; (3) errors in the bulk density of peat; and (4) errors in peat thickness (the thickness corresponding to one year of Sphagnion accumulation). A Monte Carlo study of the errors, after making a number of assumptions, shows that the tonnages are affected most by the error in model fitting (the variability resulting from residuals), next by the errors in bulk density, followed by the errors in thickness, and the analytical error and within- sample variation are the least important. For each of the studied metals, the reported emission tonnages are substantially greater than the peat-estimated tonnages. From a large number of Monte Carlo trials, the reported emission tonnage exceeds the calculated anomaly tonnage 88% of the time for Cu, 95% of the time for Pb, and 81% of the time for Zn. A somewhat less conservative test, using a different method for modeling the fitting errors, results in emission tonnages exceeding the anomaly tonnages in 98% of the trials for Cu, in 99% of the trials for Pb, and in 91% of the trials for Zn. It is concluded that although the uncertainties resulting from various sources of error are relatively large, the metal deposited within about 200 km of the smelter, as estimated from peat, cannot account for the reported metal emissions from the smelter. In the northern boreal forest environment, peat is a relatively inexpensive natural medium for monitoring particulate deposition from smelters, but more work is needed to understand whether emissions not accounted for (1) have been transported for long distances (beyond 100-200 km from the smelter), (2) are underestimated by the Sphagnum method, or (3) are the result of other sources of error not understood.","2001","2025-01-09 19:01:50","2025-03-24 19:44:14","","303-326","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000175891400016","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of sphagnum moss samples from peatlands to map the impact zone of air pollution of metals from a base metal smelter/refinery.

The SiMS model represents proton binding and metal binding as cation exchange for heterogeneous sorbents as a function of pH, salt concentration, total metal concentration and total ligand concentration. The SiMS model uses fewer parameters than other cation exchange models for multidimensional datasets and can be executed on a standard spreadsheet. The cation exchange selectivity coefficient, K-Me,K-app, is represented as K-Me,K-app = K-Me(H+)(alpha)(L-T/Me-T)I-beta(phi). The model is similar to standard surface complexation approaches, with an intrinsic relationship described by mass action laws (K-Me = metal equilibrium constant) and variable terms that are expressed as simple power functions of proton concentration, ligand to metal ratio (L-T/Me-T), and ionic strength (I). The model successfully simulated the proton exchange behavior of acid-washed, Sphagnum peats over a range of 4 to 8 pH units with ionic strength differing by three orders of magnitude (I = 0.001 to 0.1). Simulation of copper binding on five peat data sets and the dried biomass of Potamogeton lucens was also successful (0.94 < r(2) < 0.99).

Besides being plentiful and inexpensive, peat possesses several characteristics that make it an effective media for the removal of dissolved metal pollutants. The mechanism of metal ion binding to peat remains a controversial area with ion-exchange, complexation, and surface adsorption being the prevalent theories. Factors affecting adsorption include pH, loading rates, and the presence of competing metals. The optimum pH range for metals capture is generally 3.5-6.5. Although the presence of more than one metal in a solution creates competition for sorption sites and less of a particular ion may be bound, the total sorption capacity has been found to increase. Studies have also shown that metals removal is most efficient when the loading rates are low. In addition, recovery of metals and regeneration of the peat is possible using acid elution with little effect on peat's sorption capacity. The utilization of peat and other biomass materials for the treatment of wastewater containing heavy metals is gaining more attention as a simple. effective and economical means of pollution remediation. Pelleting processes can now produce a robust media for a variety of applications where traditional methods of pollutant removal would he economically or technologically difficult.","2000-11","2025-01-09 19:01:50","2025-03-07 22:08:29","","3907-3916","","16","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000089806300001","12.8","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of peat to bind and remove metal ions in solution in wastewater and proposes pelletized peat as an inexpensive solution to remove heavy metals from wastewater.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peat; pH; impact minimization; mitigation hierarchy; metal/metalloid; substrate; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main constituent in oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) with uncertain treatment by CWTS are naphthenic acid fraction compounds (NAFC)s. The NAFCs are also among the primary contributors of toxicity to aquatic organisms. While there is preliminary evidence that some CWTSs are capable of treating OSPW for future potential discharge, there is little information comparing the effectiveness and efficiencies of different CWTS designs. Obtaining large volumes of OSPW for testing can be difficult, and while it is known that synthetic NAFCs are simpler and have different toxicity than OSPW-NAFCs, it is unknown whether they could serve as a proxy for optimization of CWTS design and operation. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of CWTS performance operated with both synthetic OSPW and OSPW for four CWTS designs differing in plant type, aeration, flow path, water depth, and substrate type. This study evaluated the potential biodegradation of NAFCs including: (1) decrease in total NAFC concentration, (2) shifts in Ox-NAFC fractions from O2- to O3-, O4-, and O5-NAFC, (3) decrease in carbon number, (4) decrease of the double bond equivalencies (DBE), and (5) change in toxicity of the waters to test organisms. CWTS planted with Sedge achieved the greatest extent of NAFC treatment and detoxification regardless of design. Although CWTSs planted with Cattail and Bulrush also degraded NAFCs and decreased toxicity, a greater hydraulic retention time was required, and the total extent of treatment was less than the CWTSs planted with Sedge. While synthetic OSPW was more toxic and experienced faster degradation rates, it showed similar trends to OSPW in terms of CWTS design efficiencies and function. Although synthetic OSPW would not be appropriate for modelling or scaling of CWTSs, it can be useful for testing designs and operating conditions.","2021","2025-01-09 23:06:30","2025-03-07 22:08:28","","","","","772","","Science of the Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","9.8","1","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the design of constructed treatment wetlands to bioremediated naphthenic acid enriched wastewater from oil sand processing in the Alberta oil sands.</p> </div>","","","Canada; mining; other wetland; mineral processing; impact minimization; treatment wetland; mitigation hierarchy; bio/phytoremediation; hydrocarbons; remediation; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Areas disturbed for construction activity have soil erosion rates from 2 to 40,000 times greater than pre-construction conditions, and are important components of nonpoint source (NPS) pollution that degrades surface water quality. Despite significant local-to-watershed-scale environmental and economic impacts, the lack of an individual economic incentive for land developers to control erosion has limited voluntary adoption of erosion and sediment control measures. However, increased regulatory requirements, combined with efforts to identify and publicize the benefits of erosion control, are increasing the number of construction sites on which erosion control efforts are being implemented. Geomorphologists have the opportunity to play an active role in erosion and sediment control by implementing knowledge of erosion and sedimentation processes and of the variables that effect these processes. Pre-project geomorphological site assessments allow project designers to work around areas with high erosion potential, and to stage and schedule land disturbing activities to minimize erosion potential. Combined engineering and geomorphological analyses can increase the likelihood that streams and drainage channels are stable under altered hydrologic conditions, both during and after land use change, and can be used to design a drainage plan that minimizes surface water flow through disturbed areas. A variety of temporary measures to reduce erosion and to trap sediment on site can be designed and implemented, such as temporary surface covers, silt fence, and sedimentation basins. However, design and implementation of these measures require an understanding of erosion and sedimentation processes, and in many cases incorrect installation and maintenance limit their effectiveness. Regular on-site inspections and training by geomorphologists specializing in erosion control can ensure that measures are being installed and maintained correctly, and allow the inspector to modify the erosion control plan to deal with changing conditions and unanticipated problems. In addition, geomorphologists and engineers can use their combined understanding of erosion processes and construction site realities to develop innovative and practical measures to improve erosion control. Construction site erosion control is a field that relatively few academic geomorphologists have shown an interest in, yet has great potential both in terms of job opportunities and research. It is an area in which morphologists and engineers can work together using their complementary knowledge, both for the development and implementation of erosion control plans; as the basis for developing innovative practices; and for undertaking research on the effectiveness of traditional and new approaches to erosion control.","1999-12-01","2025-01-10 17:54:36","2025-02-25 14:25:05","","247-263","","1","31","","Geomorphology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of geomorphology to control the erosion of sediments from construction sites. </p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; substrate disturbance; water quality; pollution; erosion; impact minimization; sediment; sedimentation ponds; mitigation hierarchy; suspended solids; substrate; mine planning; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the spatial extent and causes of metal enrichment in peatlands is understudied and no attempt has been made to evaluate global patterns of metal enrichment in bog and fen peatlands, despite that certain metals and rare earth elements (REE) arise from anthropogenic sources. We analyzed 368 peat cores sampled in 16 countries across five continents and measured metal and other element concentrations at three depths down to 70 cm as well as estimated cumulative atmospheric S deposition (1850-2009) for each site. Sites were assigned to one of three distinct broadly recognized peatland categories (bog, poor fen, and intermediate-to-moderately rich fen) that varied primarily along a pH gradient. Metal concentrations differed among peatland types, with intermediate-to-moderately rich fens demonstrating the highest concentrations of most metals. Median enrichment factors (EFs; a metric comparing natural and anthropogenic metal deposition) for individual metals were similar among bogs and fens (all groups), with metals likely to be influenced by anthropogenic sources (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Sb) demonstrating median enrichment factors (EFs) > 1.5. Additionally, mean EFs were substantially higher than median values, and the positive correlation (< 0.40) with estimated cumulative atmospheric S deposition, confirmed some level of anthropogenic influence of all pollutant metals except for Hg that was unrelated to S deposition. Contrary to expectations, high EFs were not restricted to pollutant metals, with Mn, K and Rb all exhibiting elevated median EFs that were in the same range as pollutant metals likely due to peatland biogeochemical processes leading to enrichment of these nutrients in surface soil horizons. The global patterns of metal enrichment in bogs and fens identified in this study underscore the importance of these peatlands as environmental archives of metal deposition, but also illustrates that biogeochemical processes can enrich metals in surface peat and EFs alone do not necessarily indicate atmospheric contamination.","2024-02","2025-01-13 19:46:00","2025-03-12 01:56:37","2024-02-19","125-139","","2","86","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001160449600001","4","4","SC: 0000001","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the global patterns of metal, metalloid and sulphur enrichment in peatlands globally.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; bog; monitoring; pollution; air pollution; arsenic; fen; copper; lead; metal/metalloid; antimony; cobalt; cadmium; peat/sediment cores; sulphur compounds; reference conditions; fertility change/contamination; mercury/methylmercury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results of this study demonstrate that the accumulation of organic matter (OM) in near-surface sediments also influences the mobility and fate of As in sub-Arctic lakes. Sediment gravity cores, sediment grab samples, and porewaters were collected from three lakes downstream of the former Tundra gold mine, Northwest Territories, Canada. Analysis of sediment using combined micro-X-ray fluorescence/diffraction, K-edge X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES), and organic petrography shows that As is associated with both aquatic (benthic and planktonic alginate) and terrestrially derived OM (e.g., cutinite, funginite). Most As is hosted by fine-grained Fe-(oxy)hydroxides or sulfide minerals (e.g., goethite, orpiment, lepidocrocite, and mackinawite); however, grain-scale synchrotron-based analysis shows that As is also associated with amorphous OM. Mixed As oxidation states in porewater (median = 62% As (V), 18% As (III); n = 20) and sediment (median = 80% As (-I) and (III), 20% As (V); n = 9) indicate the presence of variable redox conditions in the near-surface sediment and suggest that post-depositional remobilization of As has occurred. Detailed characterization of As-bearing OM at and below the SWI suggests that OM plays an important role in stabilizing redox-sensitive authigenic minerals and associated As. Based on these findings, it is expected that increased concentrations of labile OM will drive post-depositional surface enrichment of As in mining-impacted lakes and may increase or decrease As flux from sediments to overlying surface waters.","2022-02","2025-01-13 19:46:00","2025-02-08 18:45:05","2022-03-04","","","4","81","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000756800500001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the mobility of arsenic in lakes as a result of increasing organic matter in the sediments.

The on-going climate warming is likely to increase the frequency of FTC in continental aquatic settings, which could modify the chemical composition of waters. In this study, we conducted 9 repetitive cycles of overnight freezing (similar to 20 degrees C) and 5 h thawing (4 degrees C) in the laboratory using representative 0.22 mu m-filtered waters from NE European permafrost peatland: leachates of vegetation and soil, and natural surface waters (depression, thermokarst lake and river). Only minor (<5%-15%) changes of DOC concentrations, SUVA(254) and molecular weight were observed in all leachates and the depression water. In contrast, several trace elements (Fe, Al, P, Mn, As, and REE) exhibited sizable variations during FTC (>10%). The leachates and the depression water were enriched in trace elements, whereas the thermokarst lake and the river demonstrated a decrease in concentration of Fe (similar to 39 and similar to 94%, respectively), Al (similar to 9 and similar to 85%), and Mn (similar to 10 and similar to 79%) during FTC. Overall, the observations demonstrated an increase in aliphatic low molecular weight organic matter (OM), and the precipitation of Fe, Al hydroxides and organo-mineral particles. Therefore, enhanced of frequency of FTC can favour the release of metals and toxicants from acidic OM-rich surface waters and maintain stable OM-metals colloids in large lakes and rivers, thus regulating aquatic transport of DOC and metals from soils to the Arctic Ocean.","2021-09","2025-01-13 19:46:00","2025-03-07 22:07:12","2021-07-01","","","","279","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000659971200034","8.8","2","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines role of freeze-thaw cycles in permafrost peatlands on the release of DOC and metals or metalloids.

Substantial variation in As concentrations were measured over the two-year period of study in all but the deepest lake (maximum depth 6.9 m), induding a four-fold difference in As in the shallowest lake ([As]: 172-846 mu g L-1; maximum depth 0.8 m). Arsenic concentrations were enriched following ice cover development in the three shallowest lakes (50-110%) through a combination of physical and biogeochemical processes. Early winter increases in As were associated with the exclusion of solutes from the developing ice-cover; and large increases in As were measured once oxygen conditions were depleted to the point of anoxia by mid-winter. The onset of anoxic conditions within the water column was associated with large increases in the concentration of redox sensitive elements in lake waters (As, iron [Fe], and manganese [Mn]), suggesting coupling of As mobility with Fe and Mn cyding. In contrast, there was little difference in Sb concentrations under ice suggesting that Sb mobility was controlled by factors other than Fe and Mn associated redox processes. A survey of 30 lakes in the region during fall (open-water) and late-winter (under-ice) revealed large seasonal differences in surface water As were more common in lakes with a maximum depth <4 m. This threshold highlights the importance of winter conditions and links between physical lake properties and biogeochemical processes in the chemical recovery of As-impacted subarctic landscapes. The findings indicate annual remobilization of As from contaminated lake sediments may be inhibiting recovery in small shallow lakes that undergo seasonal transitions in redox state.

In sensitive subarctic environments exploitation of mineral resources led to contamination and it is not known how cumulative effects of resource extraction and climate warming will impact ecosystems. Gold mines near Yellow knife, Northwest Territories, subarctic Canada, operated from 1938 to 2004 and released N 20,000 t of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) to the environment through stack emissions. This release resulted in elevated arsenic concentrations in lake surface waters and sediments relative to Canadian drinking water standards and guidelines for the protection of aquatic life. A meta-analytical approach is used to better understand controls on As distribution in lake sediments within a 30-kmradius of historicmineral processing activities. Arsenic concentrations in the near-surface sediments range from 5 mg.kg(-1) to over 10,000 mg.kg(-1) (median 81 mg.kg(-1); n = 105). Distance and direction from the historic roaster stack are significantly (p < 0.05) related to sedimentary As concentration, with highest As concentrations in sediments within 11 km and lakes located downwind. Synchrotron-based mu XRF and mu XRD confirm the persistence of As2O3 in near surface sediments of two lakes. Labile organic matter (S1) is significantly (p < 0.05) related to As and S concentrations in sediments and this relationship is greatest in lakes within 11 km from the mine. These relations are interpreted to reflect labile organic matter acting as a substrate for microbial growth and mediation of authigenic precipitation of As-sulphides in lakes close to the historic mine where As concentrations are highest. Continued climate warming is expected to lead to increased biological productivity and changes in organic geochemistry of lake sediments that are likely to play an important role in the mobility and fate of As in aquatic ecosystems.

In Canada's oil sands region, acid deposition is estimated to be as much as 5% of the Canadian total and large tracks of northeastern Alberta are considered acid-sensitive because of extensive peatland habitats with poorly weathered soils. To identify the frequency, duration and severity of acidification episodes during snowmelt (the predominant hydrological period for delivery of priority pollutants from atmospheric oil sands emissions to surface waters), a 25-year record (1989 to 2014) of automated water quality data (pH, temperature, conductivity) was assembled for 3 rivers along with a shorter record (2012-2014) for another 2 rivers. Acidic episodes (pH < 7, ANC < 0) were recorded during 39% of all 83 snowmelt events. The severity (duration x magnitude) of episodic acidification increased exponentially over the study period (r(2) = 0.56, P < 0.01) and was strongly correlated (P < 0.01) with increasing maximum air temperature and weakly correlated with regional land development (P = 0.06). Concentrations of aluminum and 11 priority pollutants (Sb, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Se, Ag, TI and Zn) were greatest (P <0.01) during low (<6.5) pH episodes, particularly when coincident with high discharge, such that aluminum and copper concentrations were at times high enough to pose a risk to juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Although low pH (pH < 6.5) was observed during only 8% of 32 acidification episodes, when present, low pH typically lasted 10 days. Episodic surface water acidification during snowmelt, and its potential effects on aquatic biota, is therefore an important consideration in the design of long-term monitoring of these typically alkaline (pH = 7.72 +/- 0.05) rivers.","2017-12-01","2025-01-13 19:46:01","2025-03-07 18:21:41","2017-12-01","739-749","","","599","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000405252000077","9.8","1","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>-This paper examines the effect of acidification from spring runoff and mining activities on watercourses in the AB oil sands region. </p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; hydrology; peatland; mining; water quality; surface water/runoff; watercourses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied the behavior and effects of micropollutants by means of hydrological, physico-chemical, microbiological and ecotoxicological monitoring. The highest concentrations of micropollutants in the treated wastewater were found for the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine and diclofenac, some metabolites, the sweetener acesulfame, tolyl- and benzotriazole and diatrizoate. In the underlying, shallow groundwater where treated wastewater application for rewetting had been expected to have the greatest impact due to seeping and evapotranspiration processes, only a sporadic occurrence of micropollutants was found. The influence of dilution by groundwater movements was examined by applying a geohydrological model. The sorption of micropollutants onto the peaty soil also played a role, as found for carbamazepine. Further processes such as photolysis, microbial decay under low redox conditions and plant uptake can be assumed to be relevant for the removal of many substances. Ecotoxicity tests with the soil before and after rewetting did not indicate any negative impact on the soil habitat quality by wastewater application, but clearly pointed at ecotoxicologically relevant geogenic arsenic concentrations at the study site. Although a positive effect on receiving surface water systems is expected if wastewater is applied on land instead of discharged to water bodies, the rewetted soil may turn into a sink for micropollutants in the long term. Hence, the findings of the present field study encourage further investigations in order to identify the governing processes in the elimination of micropollutants in rewetted peatlands flooded with treated wastewater.","2017-06","2025-01-13 19:46:01","2025-03-07 22:07:55","2017-06-01","","","6","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000404559900087","3.4","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of rewetting a peatland with wastewater on the water quality the peatland.</p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; rewetting; pollution; arsenic; fen; mitigation hierarchy; wastewater; water pollution; metal/metalloid; hydrological management; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In palsa peatland of western Siberia, the thermokarst lake formation includes soil subsidences, lichen submergence and peat abrasion, leading to lateral spreading of the lake border, often intensified by ground fires. Mesocosm experiments were conducted during 3 weeks on two thermokarst lake waters interacting in 30-L tanks with surface horizon of peat, the dominant ground vegetation (lichen Cladonia sp.) and the ash produced by lichen burning at 450 C. The obtained results allowed a better understanding of physico-chemical factors controlling the enrichment of thermokarst lake water in organic carbon and metals, and evaluating CO2 sequestration/emission potential. The changes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), major element and divalent metal concentration in response to peat and lichen biomass addition were less than a factor of 2 over full duration of the experiment. Iron (Fe) concentration in the lake water decreased by a factor of 2 to 3 after the addition of peat and lichen biomass. The concentration of low-soluble trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates decreased by ca. 30 to 50%, presumably due to their co-precipitation with Fe hydroxide. The dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in tank with lichen increased by a factor of 5.5 0.5, likely due to respiration of algal component in closed environment Strong enrichment of the lake water in DIC, P, K, Ca, Mg, Si, Al, Ti, Mn, Mo, Rb, As, Sb and U upon the ash addition persisted over full duration of experiments and was significant (p <0.0001) compared to peat and lichen biomass treatments.

Under low-flow stream conditions, flocs may settle, become buried, and eventually be subjected to reducing conditions facilitating trace metal(loid) release. In this study, we reacted freshwater flocs (704-1280 mg As/kg) from a minerotrophic peatland (Gola di Lago, Switzerland) with sulfide (5.2 mM, S(-II)(spike)/Fe = 0.75 1.62 mol/mol) at neutral pH and studied the speciation changes of Fe, S, and As at 25 +/- 1 degrees C over 1 week through a combination of synchrotron X-ray techniques and wet-chemical analyses. Sulfidization of floc ferrihydrite and nanocrystalline lepidocrocite caused the rapid formation of mackinawite (52-81% of Fe-solid at day 7) as well as solid-phase associated S(0) and polysulfides. Ferrihydrite was preferentially reduced over lepidocrocite, although neoformation of lepidocrocite from ferrihydrite could not be excluded. Sulfide-ieacted flocs contained primarily arsenate (47-72%) which preferentially adsorbed to Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)oxides, despite abundant mackinawite precipitation. At higher S(-II)(spike)/Fe molar ratios (>= 1.0), the formation of an orpiment-like phase accounted for up to 35% of solid-phase As. Despite Fe and As sulfide precipitation and the presence of residual Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)wddes, mobilization of As was recorded in all samples (As-aq = 0.45-7.0 mu M at 7 days). Aqueous As speciation analyses documented the formation of thioarsenates contributing up to 33% of As-aq. Our findings show that freshwater flocs from the Gola di Lago peatland may become a source of As under sulfate-reducing conditions and emphasize the pivotal role Fe-rich organic freshwater flocs play in trace metal(loid) cycling in S-rich wetlands characterized by oscillating redox conditions.","2016-04-05","2025-01-13 19:46:01","2025-02-08 18:46:03","2016-04-05","3607-3616","","7","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000373655800037","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the biogeochemistry of a naturally arsenic and sulphur enriched fen peatland in Switzerland and points to the mechanisms of arsenic capture, but also its release. &nbsp;</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; hydrology; peatland; peat; groundwater; water table; contaminant transport; arsenic; fen; metal/metalloid; sulphur compounds; substrate; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparatively little information is available on peat chronological records of atmospheric TMs flux in China. Therefore, the objective of our study was to determine the concentrations and accumulation rates (ARs) of TMs in Motianling peatland from Great Hinggan Mountain, northeast China, and to assess these in relation to establish a historical profile of atmospheric metal emissions from anthropogenic sources. To meet these aims we analyzed 14 TMs (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sr, Sb, Tl, and Zn) and Pb isotopes (Pb-206, Pb-207, Pb-208) using ICP-AES and ICP-MS, respectively, in three peat sections dated by Pb-210 and Cs-137 techniques (approximately spanning the last 200 years). There is a general agreement in the elemental concentration profiles which suggests that all investigated elements were conserved in the Motianling bog. Three principal components were discriminated by principal component analysis (PCA) based on Eigen-values >1 and explaining 85% of the total variance of element concentrations: the first component representing Ba, Co, Cr, Mo, Ni, Sr and Tl reflected the lithogenic source; the second component covering As, Cu and Sb, and Cd is associated with an anthropogenic source from ore mining and processing; the third component (Pb isotope, Pb and Zn) is affected by anthropogenic Pb pollution from industrial manufacturing and fossil-fuel combustion. The pre-industrial background of typical pollution elements was estimated as the average concentrations of TMs in peat samples prior to 1830 AD and with a Pb-207/Pb-206 ratio close to 1.9. ARs and enrichment factors (EFs) of TMs suggested enhanced metal concentrations near the surface of the peatland (in peat layers dated from the 1980s) linked to an increasing trend since the 2000s. This pollution pattern is also fingerprinted by the Pb isotopic composition, even after the ban of leaded gasoline use in China. Emissions from coal and leaded gasoline combustions in northern China are regarded as one of the major sources of anthropogenic Pb input in this region; meanwhile, the long-distance transportation of Pb-bearing aerosols from Mongolia should be also taken into consideration. The reconstructed history of TMs' pollution over the past ca. 200 years is in agreement with the industrial development in China and clearly illustrates the influence of human activities on local rural environments. This study shows the utility of taking multi-cores to show the heterogeneity in peat accumulation and applying PCA, EF and Pb isotope methods in multi-proxies analyses for establishing a high resolution geochemical metal record from peatland.","2015-03","2025-01-13 19:46:01","2025-02-10 13:47:14","2015-03-01","380-409","","3","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000351941800009","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of peat cores to follow anthropogenic inputs of metals and metalloids in peatlands in China.

Pb and As are exported along with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from these organic-rich systems, but it is not yet clear which hydrological (pre) conditions favor their export. This study combines a 1-year monitoring of precipitation, bog water level and pore water concentration changes with bog discharge and DOC, iron, As and Pb stream concentrations. From these data, annual DOC, As, and Pb exports were calculated. Concentrations ranged from 5 to 30 mg L-1 for DOC, 0.2 to 1.9 mu g L-1 for As, and 1.3 to 12 mu g L-1 for Pb, with highest concentrations in late summer. As and Pb concentrations significantly correlated with DOC concentrations. Fluxes depended strongly on discharge, as 40% of As and 43% of Pb were exported during 10% of the time with the highest discharge, pointing out the over-proportional contribution of short-time, high-discharge events to annual As, Pb and DOC export. Exponential increase in element export from the bog is explained by connection of additional DOC, As and Pb pools in the acrotelm during water table rise, which is most pronounced after drought. Pb, As and DOC concentrations in pore water provide evidence of an increase in the soluble Pb pool as soon as the peat layer becomes hydrologically connected, while DOC and As peak concentrations in runoff lag behind in comparison to Pb. Our data indicate a distinct bog-specific discharge threshold of 8 L s(-1), which is thought to depend mainly on the bogs size and drainage conditions. Above this threshold, element concentrations do not further increase and discharge becomes diluted. Combining pore water and discharge data shows that As and Pb exports are dependent on not only the amount of precipitation and discharge but also on the frequency and depth of water table fluctuations. Comparing the annual bog As and Pb export with element inventories indicates that As is much more mobilized than Pb, with annual fluxes accounting for 0.85 and 0.27% of total As and Pb inventory, respectively.","2015","2025-01-13 19:46:01","2025-03-07 22:08:30","2015-09-09","4651-4664","","15","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000360003700007","4.9","2","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the hydrological controls on the movement of DOC, As and Pb from a mining-polluted peatland in Germany. </p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; mining; contaminant transport; pollution; air pollution; impact minimization; arsenic; mine wastes; mitigation hierarchy; lead; metal/metalloid; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a robust and versatile gas trapping method for the simultaneous preconcentration of volatile selenium (Se), sulfur (S), and arsenic (As) species. Using HPLC-HR-ICP- MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses, we demonstrate that volatile Se and S species efficiently transform into specific non-volatile compounds during trapping, which enables the deduction of the original gaseous speciation. With minor adaptations, the presented HPLC-HR-ICP-MS method also allows for the quantification of 13 non-volatile methylated species and oxyanions of Se, S, and As in natural waters. Application of these methods in a peatland indicated that, at the selected sites, fluxes varied between 190-210 ng Se.m(-2).d(-1), 90-270 ng As.m(-2).d(-1), and 4-14 mu g S.m(-2).d(-1), and contained at least 70% methylated Se and S species.

In this study, we explored their oxidation kinetics in peat exposed to atmospheric O-2 for up to 180 days under sterile and nonsterile conditions (25 degrees C, similar to 100% relative humidity). Anoxic peat samples were collected from a near-surface (0-38 cm) and a deep peat layer (200-250 cm) and studied by bulk As, Fe, and S K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy as well as selective extractions as a function of time. Over 180 days, only up to 33% of organosulfur-coordinated As(III) and 44% of realgar were oxidized, corresponding to half-life times, t(1/2), of 312 and 215 days, respectively. The oxidation of both As species was mainly controlled by abiotic processes. Realgar was oxidized orders of magnitude slower than predicted from published mixed-flow reactor experiments, indicating that mass-transfer processes were rate-limiting. Most of the As released (>97%) was sequestered by Fe(III)-(hydr)oxides. However, water-extractable As reached concentrations of 0.7-19 mu mol As L-1, exceeding the WHO drinking water limit by up to 145 times. Only a fraction (20-36%) of reduced S(-II to I) was sensitive to oxidation and was oxidized faster (t(1/2) = 50-173 days) than organosulfur-coordinated As(III) and realgar, suggesting a rapid loss of reactive As-sequestering S species following a drop in the water table. Our results imply that wetlands like Gala di Lago can serve as long-term sources for As under prolonged oxidizing conditions. The maintenance of reducing conditions is thus regarded as the primary strategy in the management of this and other As-rich peatlands.","2014-02-18","2025-01-13 19:46:01","2025-03-07 22:08:29","2014-02-18","2281-2289","","4","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000331774100023","11.4","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the mechanisms of removal of arsenic in peat &nbsp;and point to the importance of sulphur compounds. </p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peat; impact minimization; arsenic; mitigation hierarchy; metal/metalloid; sulphur compounds; substrate; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we elucidated the molecular-scale interaction of arsenite (As(III)) with Fe(III) NOM complexes under reducing conditions. We reacted peat (40-250 pm size fraction, 1.0 g Fe/kg) with 0-15 g Fe/kg at pH <2, removed nonreacted Fe, and subsequently equilibrated the Fe(III) complexes formed with 900 mg As/kg peat at pH 7.0, 8.4, and 8.8. The solid-phase speciation of Fe and As was studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (Fe) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (As, Fe). Our results show that the majority of Fe in the peat was present as mononuclear Fe(III) species (RFe-c = 2.82-2.88 angstrom), probably accompanied by small Fe(III) clusters of low nuclearity (RFe-Fe = 3.25-3.46 angstrom) at high pH and elevated Fe contents. The amount of As(III) retained by the original peat was 161 mg As/kg, which increased by up to 250% at pH 8.8 and an Fe loading of 7.3 g/kg. With increasing Fe content of peat, As(III) increasingly formed bidentate mononuclear (RAs-Fe = 2.88-2.94 angstrom) and monodentate binuclear (RAs-Fe = 3.35-3.41 angstrom) complexes with Fe, thus yielding direct evidence of ternary complex formation. The ternary complex formation went along with a ligand exchange reaction between As(III) and hydroxylic/phenolic groups of the peat (RAs-C = 2.70-2.77 angstrom). Our findings thus provide spectroscopic evidence for two yet unconfirmed As(III) NOM interaction mechanisms, which may play a vital role in the cycling of As in sub- and anoxic NOM-rich environments such as peatlands, peaty sediments, swamps, or rice paddies.","2013-11-05","2025-01-13 19:46:01","2025-02-25 14:22:32","2013-11-05","12165-12173","","21","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000326711300038","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the binding mechanisms of arsenic with peat and other organic matter.

Under oxic conditions, natural organic matter promotes arsenic release from metal-(hydr)oxides, thereby enhancing arsenic mobility. Under strongly reducing conditions, however, organic matter triggers the formation of arsenic-sequestering sulphides, leading to a reduction in arsenic mobility. Furthermore, the sorption of arsenic to natural organic matter is increasingly thought to suppress arsenic mobility, but the binding mechanisms have remained elusive. Here we use X-ray absorption spectroscopy to analyse the speciation of solid-phase arsenic in peat samples collected from a naturally arsenic-enriched peatland in Switzerland. We show that natural organic matter can completely sequester arsenic through the formation of covalent bonds between trivalent arsenic and organic sulphur groups, which have an average arsenic-sulphur bond distance of 2.26 angstrom.

The aim of this study was to investigate As retention and release in atmospheric ally contaminated ombrotrophic peat soils in the Peak District National Park (UK). Solid phase As concentrations in the peat soils exceed 25 mg kg(-1). Solid phase As and Fe concentrations are closely correlated at sites where the peat is subjected to drying and oxic conditions. in a wetter zone of the bog, solid phase As and Fe distributions are decoupled, suggesting that As retention in these systems is not solely controlled by the presence of Fe oxides. Comparison of solid phase As and Pb distributions reveals that As has been subjected to post-depositional mobility in areas of water table fluctuation. Conversely, at permanently waterlogged locations As is immobile. Detailed stream water sampling reveals that As is released from the organic-rich uplands soils into the fluvial system. Dissolved As concentrations are highly variable, with values ranging from 0.20 to 7.28 mu g l(-1). Stream water As concentrations are elevated during late summer storm flow periods when there has been re-wetting of the peat after significant water table draw-down. Dissolved As is strongly correlated to dissolved organic carbon under stormflow and baseflow. The results of this study suggest that organic matter plays an important role in As dynamics in ombrotrophic peatlands, but further work is needed to identify the exact As binding and release mechanisms. Drying and re-wetting of ombrotrophic peat soils and associated changes in redox status has the potential to lead to increased As mobility. Further work is needed to provide information on how predicted climate change will influence As cycling at sites containing a legacy of atmospheric contamination. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The experiment included a drought/rewetting treatment, a permanently wet, and a defoliated treatment. Soil water content was determined by the TDR technique, and arsenic, iron and sulfate turnover from mass balancing stocks and fluxes in the peat, and solid phase contents by sequential extractions. Arsenic content ranged from 5 to 25 mg kg(-1) and dissolved concentrations from 10 to 300 pg L-1, mainly in form of As(III), and secondarily of As(V) and dimethylated arsenic (DMA). Total arsenic was mainly associated with amorphous iron hydroxides (R-2 > 0.95, alpha < 0.01) and deeper into the peat with an unidentified residual fraction. Arsenic release was linked to ferrous iron release and primarily occurred in the intensely rooted uppermost soil. Volumetric air contents of 2-13% during drought eliminated DMA from the porewater and suppressed its release after rewetting for >30 d. Dissolved As(III) was oxidized and immobilized as As(V) at rates of up to 0.015 mmol m(-3) d(-1). Rewetting mobilized As(III) at rates Of LIP to 0.018 mmol m(-3) d(-1) within days. Concurrently, Fe(I 1) was released at depth integrated rates of up 20 mmol m(-3) d(-1). The redox half systems of arsenic, iron, and sulfur were in persistent disequilibrium, with H,S being a thermodynamically viable reductant for As(V) to As(III).

Fragmentary archaeological evidence exists for the exploitation of these mineral resources from the mid-Bronze Age onwards (ca. 1000 BC). This paper explores the usefulness of two peatland systems in revealing the history of trace metal pollution associated with this activity in the south west peninsula and further afield. Using quantitative XRF analyses it was possible to reconstruct the pollution histories for the two sites investigated by analysis of Cu, Zn, As and Pb. Results are presented both as element concentration profiles and as enrichment factors using ash content to normalise the data. Tor Royal, a large raised mire on Dartmoor, contained a regional signal suggesting that concentrations of trace metals began to rise following mid-Neolithic (ca 2500 BC) disturbance activity on the moor. Sustained increases are noted from this period with a definite peak detected in peats dating from the period of Roman occupation (ca. AD 0-400). The Pb profile displays the characteristic industrial revolution increase and recent decline, the result of the decline in British Pb mining, and the use of lead based petrol additives. Crift Down, a small soligenous mire, displays a more local signal of which the most significant features include the high concentrations of lithogenic elements: rubidium (Rb), yttrium (Y) and uranium (U), and metals (Cu and Zn). Qualitative analyses of the sediments using EDMA provides qualified evidence of local Sn extraction and processing operations, known from archaeological excavations, to date from the Medieval period (10th to 14th centuries AD). Regional variations in atmospheric pollution are also recorded, particularly for Pb. The detection of early mineral exploitation in sediments of this kind is an important step in understanding the extent and nature of mining and smelting in the past history of south west England.","1997-12","2025-01-13 19:46:02","2025-03-12 01:56:26","1997-12-01","343-353","","3-4","100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1997YH31900011","2.9","4","SC: 0000094","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that peat cores provide long-term records of trace metals from mining, going back millennia.</p> </div>","","","peatland; mining; peat; mineral processing; monitoring; pollution; copper; lead; zinc; metal/metalloid; peat/sediment cores; substrate; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To support policy development for biodiversity offsets, we review a set of major offset policy frameworks-US wetlands mitigation, US conservation banking, EU Natura 2000, Australian offset policies in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia, and Brazilian industrial and forest offsets. We compare how the frameworks define offset policy goals, approach the mitigation process, and address six key issues for implementing offsets: (1) equivalence of project impacts with offset gains; (2) location of the offset relative to the impact site; (3) ""additionality"" (a new contribution to conservation) and acceptable types of offsets; (4) timing of project impacts versus offset benefits; (5) offset duration and compliance; and (6) ""currency"" and mitigation replacement ratios. We find substantial policy commonalities that may serve as a sound basis for future development of biodiversity offsets policy. We also identify issues requiring further policy guidance, including how best to: (1) ensure conformance with the mitigation hierarchy; (2) identify the most environmentally preferable offsets within a landscape context; and (3) determine appropriate mitigation replacement ratios.","2010-01","2025-01-14 17:19:54","2025-03-07 22:08:26","2010-01-01","165-176","","1","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000274206500015","3.5","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews global policy frameworks for biodiversity offsets, including wetland offsets.</p> </div>","","","offsetting; policy discussion paper; wetland policy; mitigation hierarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We identified large gaps between the global implementation of offsets and the evidence for their effectiveness: despite two-thirds of the world's biodiversity offsets being applied in forested ecosystems, we found none of four studies demonstrated successful NNL outcomes for forested habitats or species. We also found no evidence for NNL achievement using avoided loss offsets (impacts offset by protecting existing habitat elsewhere).

Promising to make economic development compatible with biodiversity conservation, BO mechanisms appear as the new tool for biodiversity conservation, and they are increasingly integrated into agendas and strategies to biodiversity. The concept has also become popular with scholars but it is still highly debated in particular its ecological consequences. Moreover, this recent enthusiasm for BO has led to confusion especially on its emergence and development in the academic sphere, and its implications for conservation. This article addresses these issues. It examines the origins, characteristics and dynamics of BO in academic output and highlights the main drivers of its development, to finally conclude on its implications for conservation practice. We carried out a systematic literature review based on thorough scientometric analyses of the scientific literature on BO recorded in the Web of Science database over the past three decades (1984-2014). Through the analysis of 477 articles we identified three stages in the development of the topic in academia, and highlighted the influence of specific countries, authors, research areas and articles. We found that non-academic institutions were particularly influential, notably environmental non-governmental organizations. Furthermore, we identified a major change in the past decade in the topics and lexicon related to BO, which has moved from ecologically-driven approaches to an economic and market lexicon. Overall, this review highlights the use of an economic rhetoric to frame the BO discourse resulting from political influence rather than an actual scientific progress in ecological or economic sciences. This trend seems aligned with a new movement in conservation aimed at using economic approaches to justify and achieve conservation goals. Caught in a strong normative current and supported by a specific view of nature, we argue that BO is not a neutral concept for conservation practice. We therefore advocate the wise and careful use of this mechanism in practice, and further research be carried out to examine the theoretical and practical dimensions of BO, and the ethical implications underlying its development.","2015-12","2025-01-14 17:19:55","2025-03-07 22:08:26","2015-12-01","492-503","","","192","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000366540600059","5.9","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper completes a meta-analysis of biodiversity offsetting and its origins.

Data extracted from these files were pooled and analyzed to provide an indication of the types of HADDs that have been authorized in Canada, what habitats have been affected, and what habitat management approaches have been used when compensating for HADDs and monitoring and ensuring the success of the compensation. Determinations regarding the effectiveness of habitat compensation in achieving NNL were made. Impacts to 419,562 m(2) of fish habitat from the 124 authorized HADDs were offset by 1,020,388 m(2) Of compensatory habitat. Eighty percent of the authorizations had compensation ratios (compensation area: HADD area) of 2:1 or less, and 25% of the authorizations had a compensation ratio that was less than 1:1. In-channel and riparian habitat were the most frequently impacted habitats. Urban development and roads and highways resulted in the greatest areal loss of habitat. The compensation option that was most often selected was the creation of in-kind habitat. The mean duration of post-construction monitoring programs was 3.7 years. Determinations of NNL could only be made for 17 authorizations as a result of poor proponent compliance with monitoring requirements and the qualitative assessment procedures used by the monitoring programs.

The net C balance is dominated by the difference of two large continuous fluxes: C uptake (net primary production) and release during decomposition (heterotrophic respiration). Additional releases of C can be high in years, or in areas, that experience large anthropogenic or natural disturbances. From 1990 to 2008, Canada's managed boreal forest has acted as C sink of 28 Tg C year(-1), removing CO2 from the atmosphere to replace the 17 Tg of C annually harvested and store an additional 11 Tg of C year-1 in ecosystem C pools. A large fraction (similar to 57%) of the C harvested since 1990 remains stored in wood products and solid waste disposal sites in Canada and abroad, replacing C emitted from the decay or burning of wood harvested prior to 1990 and contributing to net increases in product and landfill C pools. Wood product use has reduced emissions in other sectors by substituting for emission-intensive products (concrete, steel). The C balance of the unmanaged boreal forest is currently unknown. The future C balance of the Canadian boreal forest will affect the global atmospheric C budget and influence the mitigation efforts required to attain atmospheric CO2 stabilization targets. The single biggest threat to C stocks is human-caused climate change. Large C stocks have accumulated in the boreal because decomposition is limited by cold temperatures and often anoxic environments. Increases in temperatures and disturbance rates could result in a large net C source during the remainder of this century and beyond. Uncertainties about the impacts of global change remain high, but we emphasize the asymmetry of risk: sustained large-scale increases in productivity are unlikely to be of sufficient magnitude to offset higher emissions from increased disturbances and heterotrophic respiration. Reducing the uncertainties of the current and future C balance of Canada's 270 Mha of boreal forest requires addressing gaps in monitoring, observation, and quantification of forest C dynamics, with particular attention to 125 Mha of unmanaged boreal forest with extensive areas of deep organic soils, peatlands, and permafrost containing large quantities of C that are vulnerable to global warming.","2013","2025-01-14 17:19:55","2025-03-12 01:56:25","2013-01-01","260-292","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000328470300004","5.7","2","SC: 0000388","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the carbon storage in Canada’s boreal forest and the ability of boreal ecosystems including peatlands to take up greenhouse gases and thereby mitigate for climate change.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; climate change; peatland; greenhouse gases; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; impact avoidance; Boreal Shield; mitigation hierarchy; Hudson Bay Lowland; carbon storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Remote sensing, palynology and peat stratigraphy studies confirm rapid and massive loss of aapa mires through recent drainage, but now also through climate change. Botanists report that recent warming has caused enhanced successional expansions in ombrotrophic raised mire vegetation to engulf aapa mires, destroying their unique surface and nutrient characteristics. As the waterbird species associated with aapa mires cannot survive on acidic base-poor raised mire systems, this ecological change places their populations in jeopardy. While acknowledging the need to reduce climate change through other means, these changes prioritize the need for international cooperation to extend and improve site-safeguarding of intact aapa mires and restoration of damaged aapa mires, as well as effective conservation of affected avian species throughout their full annual cycle to safeguard them, aapa mires and their associated bird communities for future generations.

Ecosystem-wide monitoring of the functions associated with these services is necessary to better inform policy and management and facilitate carbon financing schemes. Mapping peatland vegetation as an ecological indicator of their functions using drones has proven promising herein, yet the absence of standardised methods limits implementation. We developed drone-derived vegetation maps and compared them with two types of field-based groundreference maps: 1) habitat distribution (ecotopes) and 2) habitat quality (status) for five Irish peatlands (35 -124 ha). We also explored spatial transferability of our mapping approach across peatlands. First, orthomosaics and digital terrain models (DTM) were derived from drone imagery, after which plant functional types and microforms were separately classified. Second, ecotope and status maps were classified using the proportions of the fine-scale vegetation and the range in DTM within 20x20m grid cells as input predictor variables. Drone-derived ecotope and status maps captured the overall vegetation zonation of the conventional maps well, with the least mismatches for the peatlands displaying clear concentric zonation. Classification performance ranged between 88% for status and 72% for ecotope maps between peatlands. The lower classification performance for ecotopes was partly an artifact from gridding the conventional polygon-shaped ground-reference maps. Further classification errors resulted from artificial landscape features, variable plant phenology, and inaccuracies in the detrended DTM data at peatland-scale. Spatial transferability of the mapping approach was limited. Particularly, using pooled ground-reference data for classification decreased model performance with 5% for status and 10% for ecotope maps, largely because microform and plant functional type proportions associated with peatland habitat classes in the conventional maps varied between peatlands. Our findings highlight that both fine-scale vegetation patterns and habitats can be classified consistently on the peatland-scale using drone-derived imagery products and machine learning classifications. Yet, status is currently mapped notably more accurately than ecotopes. Also, peatland-specific ground-reference data is required until the conventional vegetation classes are more standardised across a wider variety of peatlands and peatland types.","2024-09","2025-01-14 17:26:05","2025-11-18 20:16:01","","","","","166","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001262025300001","6.9","2","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper tests standard drone flights to monitor vegetation and its changes in peatland habitats.</p> </div>","","","peatland; vegetation; remote sensing; monitoring; unmanned aerial vehicle; Drones; Ecological indicators; Habitat; Peatlands; Raised bogs; Vegetation patterns","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some species can persist in these areas through tolerance to meta(loid)s via, e.g., metabolic transformations. Due to the interaction between microorganisms and meta(loid)s, interest in the investigation of microbial communities and their possible applications (like bioremediation or biomining) has increased. The main goal of the present study was to identify, isolate, and characterize microorganisms, from subarctic mine sites, tolerant to the metalloid antimony (Sb) and the metal copper (Cu). During both summer and winter, samples were collected from Finnish mine sites (site A and B, tailings, and site C, a water-treatment peatland) and environmental parameters were assessed. Microorganisms tolerant to Sb and Cu were successfully enriched under low temperatures (4 degrees C), creating conditions that promoted the growth of aerobic and fermenting metal(loid) tolerating or anaerobic metal(loid) respiring organism. Microbial communities from the environment and Sb/Cu-enriched microorganisms were studied via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.

From enrichments, 65 putative Sb- and Cu-metabolizing microorganisms were isolated, showing growth at 0.1 mM to 10 mM concentrations and 0 degrees C to 40 degrees C temperatures. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the isolates indicated that most of the putative anaerobically Sb-respiring tolerators were related to the genus Clostridium.

Although anthropogenic Hg deposition has decreased over the past 20 years, our watersheds continue to be sources of Hg to downstream communities. Wetlands, especially peatlands in the Boreal Region of the globe, play a vital role in the formation of bioaccumulative methylmercury (MeHg). Few studies have assessed how increases in temperatures such as those that have already occurred and those predicted will influence the hydrologic transport of Hg to downstream communities or the net fluxes of gaseous Hg. The results indicate that peatland pore water concentrations of MeHg are increasing with ecosystem warming, and to some degree with elevated carbon dioxide (eCO2) in the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment at the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF) in northern Minnesota, USA. Similar to SPRUCE, in the Biological Response to A Changing Environment (BRACE) experiment in Canada, mesocosm pore water MeHg concentrations increased with soil warming. However, long-term peatland watershed streamflow fluxes of MeHg at the MEF indicate that the competing effects of climate warming and decreased atmospheric deposition have led to overall decreases in watershed MeHg transport. Mesocosm studies in the PEATCOSM experiment in Upper Michigan, USA, indicate that simulated fluctuating water tables led to higher concentrations of MeHg in peatland pore water that is available for downstream transport when water tables rise and the next runoff event occurs. Results from a winter peatland soil freeze/thaw simulation from large mesocosm cores from Jennie's Bog at the MEF indicate higher total Hg (THg) upon soil thawing but lower MeHg, likely a result of cold temperatures limiting methylation during thawing. Although there are lower MeHg concentrations after thawing, more THg is available for methylation once soils warm. Results from PEATCOSM and the literature also suggest that plant community changes that result in higher densities of sedges also lead to elevated MeHg in pore water. From a climate warming perspective, it appears that two complementary mechanisms, both related to decomposition, are at play that lead to increased pore water MeHg concentrations with warming. First, warming increases decomposition rates, leading to a higher availability of many ions, including Hg (and sulfur) species. Higher decomposition rates also lead to increases in soluble carbon which complexes with Hg species and assists in downstream hydrologic transport. However, if streamflow is decreasing with climate change as a result of landscape-level changes in evapotranspiration as suggested at MEF, the combination of less direct watershed Hg deposition and lower streamflow results in decreases in the watershed transport of MeHg. Given changes already occurring in extreme events and the rewetting and restoration of hydrology during peatland restoration, it is likely that methylation and pore water MeHg concentrations will increase. However, the landscape-level hydrologic cycle will be key to understanding the connection to downstream aquatic communities. Finally, gaseous Hg fluxes increase with warming and lead to decreases in peatland pools of Hg that may influence future availability for downstream transport.","2024-04","2025-01-14 17:26:05","2025-03-07 22:07:10","","","","8","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001210635100001","3.4","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the influence of soil warming on the release and methylation of mercury from peats.

To inform management and conservation of wildlife, camera traps can help investigate habitat preferences. We aimed to evaluate the effect of habitat features on the occupancy of mammals and birds in boreal wetlands, namely beaver ponds and peatland ponds. We used a multispecies occupancy model to estimate the habitat associations of 11 mammals and 45 avian species detected at 50 ponds during the summers of 2018 and 2019 in Northern Quebec. The patterns of habitat response do not lend support to the hypothesis that beaver ponds host higher levels of occupancy of birds and mammals than peatland ponds. Our results suggest that certain mammals, such as Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and River Otters (Lontra canadensis), and birds including the American Pipit (Anthus rubescens), Common Raven (Corvus corax), Hooded Merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus), and Greater Yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca) preferred peatland ponds, whereas the Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) preferred beaver ponds. We found a few effects of distance to roads, but no effect of amount of forest cover on species occupancy. The occupancy of 27% of mammals and 24% of birds decreased with increasing latitude.

The study system was a large before-after-control-impact (BACI) experiment along forested mixotrophic bog edges, where we sampled macroinvertebrates prior to and after the restoration that had created a total of 308 individual pools along former ditch channels. The mean abundance and taxon richness increased similarly in drain-blocked and control ditches between 2015 and 2021 but blocked and control ditches started to host distinct communities. Most pronounced changes were the decrease in the numbers of bivalves and plecopterans and the appearance of vagile species, such as odonatans, hemipterans and certain beetles and flies to blocked ditches, including several characteristic species.

Pools are ubiquitous features of many peatlands and can contain very high concentrations of C mobilized in dissolved and particulate organic form and as the greenhouses gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The radiocarbon content (C-14) of these aquatic C forms tells us whether pool C is generated by contemporary primary production or from destabilized C released from deep peat layers where it was previously stored for millennia. We present novel C-14 and stable C (delta C-13) isotope data from 97 aquatic samples across six peatland pool locations in the United Kingdom with a focus on dissolved and particulate organic C and dissolved CO2. Our observations cover two distinct pool types: natural peatland pools and those formed by ditch blocking efforts to rewet peatlands (restoration pools). The pools were dominated by contemporary C, with the majority of C (similar to 50%-75%) in all forms being younger than 300 years old. Both pool types readily transform and decompose organic C in the water column and emit CO2 to the atmosphere, though mixing with the atmosphere and subsequent CO2 emissions was more evident in natural pools. Our results show little evidence of destabilization of deep, old C in natural or restoration pools, despite the presence of substantial millennial-aged C in the surrounding peat. One possible exception is CH4 ebullition (bubbling), with our observations showing that millennial-aged C can be emitted from peatland pools via this pathway. Our results suggest that restoration pools formed by ditch blocking are effective at preventing the release of deep, old C from rewetted peatlands via aquatic export.","2024-01","2025-01-14 17:26:05","2025-03-12 01:42:46","","","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001096416000001","11.6","1","SC: 0000006","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the release of greenhouse gases from natural versus created pools.

Rewilding northern high latitude regions with large herbivores has been proposed as a climate mitigation strategy to protect frozen soils and increase ecosystem resilience to climate warming. We explored the impact of summer reindeer density on subarctic peatlands by comparing 17 peatlands differing in reindeer density in Fennoscandia. We used a combination of high-resolution image analyses and field assessments along 50 transects to assess microtopography, surface water cover, vegetation, summer albedo, permafrost presence, soil temperature, soil nutrients and snow depth. Our results show that high summer reindeer densities fragment the characteristic bumpy topography of the peatlands, reducing the insulating soil properties and the probability of keeping permafrost in elevated hummocks. As a result, waterlogged lawns with surface water increase in size and reduce summer albedo. Furthermore, high reindeer density peatlands were associated with an increase in tall inedible shrubs and thicker snow layers. These changes may favor summer warming and reduce winter cooling of the soil thus accelerating permafrost loss. Our results suggest that high reindeer densities may reduce resilience of the peatland permafrost to climate warming. High densities of large herbivores will likely have different effects in well-drained uplands, but in the lowlands we studied, the complex cascading effects of summer trampling may well offset any climate-protection gained by browsing. Optimal use of wildlife management to mitigate global warming will thus require tuning herbivore densities to different ecosystem types across high northern landscapes.","2023-08-31","2025-01-14 17:26:05","2025-03-12 01:49:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001062540600001","3.7","2","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- &nbsp;This paper examines the impact of increasing caribou populations on peatlands and their abilities to store carbon in Scandinavia. </p> </div>","","","species-at-risk; climate change; peatland; permafrost; permafrost thaw; substrate disturbance; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; caribou; fauna; mammals; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate change-driven increases in average annual temperature in coming decades will be amplified at higher latitudes and will modify many biogeochemical processes in high boreal and subarctic peatlands that are important landscape features in these regions. Changes in water quality are an important issue for Northern ecosystems and fish consumers, and the directionality of changes in mercury levels due to climate warming presents considerable uncertainty. Peatlands are key landscape hotspots for MeHg production, however, the impact of climate warming on Hg cycling in boreal peatlands is not well studied. We use a multi-year field-based warming experiment (2 years passive, 1 year active ground warming) across two boreal peatland types (moss and sedge dominated) to explore the effects of ground warming on inorganic Hg (IHg) release, net MeHg production, and biogeochemical controls on both of these processes including the availability of sulfate (SO4 (2-)) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality and concentration. There were higher porewater IHg and MeHg concentrations under active ground warming conditions in both peatlands, likely related to both increased microbial metabolism, and changes in biogeochemical conditions that favor Hg methylation. Both SO4 (2-) (electron acceptor) and bioaccessible DOM (electron donor) are nutrients for sulfate-reducing bacteria which are dominant Hg methylators in freshwater environments, and increases in SO4 (2-) and/or bioaccessible DOM concentrations under warming played an important role in the observed changes in net MeHg production. Warming increased SO4 (2-) concentrations in the sedge-dominated but not in the moss-dominated fen likely because of a larger pool of groundwater derived SO4 (2-) in the sedge-dominated site. Warming increased DOM concentration in both peatland sites through enhanced decomposition of peat and increased release of root exudates from vascular plants, and the balance of these processes varied by peatland type and degree of warming. Experimentally increased ground temperatures increased microbial metabolism, organic matter turnover, and the availability of IHg all of which resulted in increases in porewater MeHg, indicating that climate-driven ground warming will increase MeHg production in northern peatlands in the future.","2023-04-14","2025-01-14 17:26:05","2025-03-07 22:07:12","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000980055300001","4.6","3 (低预警)","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of ground warming on the release of total and methylmercury from peatlands in northern Ontario.

In this study, we analyse a forested peatland restoration experiment in Estonia from a functional perspective of amphibian populations. In 2014-2020, we surveyed a before-after-control-impact experiment that combined two habitat manipulations: partial cuttings for restoring sparse tree canopy cover, and ditch blocking with soil filling to restore the water table. We monitored the responses in the aquatic habitats and breeding of brown frogs (moor frog Rana arvalis and common frog R. temporaria). Along with the expected habitat changes (ditch blocking quadrupled water depths and tree cutting reduced the shade), we found that ditch blocking restored the soil-type specific water acidity levels that the draining had homogenized. Partial ditch blocking reduced frog breeding activity in the first year, but it recovered and increased later on, specifically on sapric Histosols and supported by temporary wetlands, floods and pools created. However, the number of offspring did not clearly respond to the restoration and instead varied much among years. Our results indicate that, in drained forested wetlands: (i) near-natural aquatic habitats are a distinct restoration target and several years of post-restoration monitoring are needed to confirm the development of ecological integrity; (ii) increased breeding activity of amphibians may not result in improved recruitment; and thus, (iii) integrative wetland restoration techniques could benefit from an ""amphibian perspective"" of sustaining their whole life cycles and the food webs they support.","2023-07","2025-01-14 17:26:05","2025-03-12 01:48:42","","","","","192","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000978051000001","3.8","2","SC: 0000003","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of ditch blocking and tree cutting on the recovery of peatlands, especially peatland pools.

In addition to the more widely studied greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane, permafrost-affected soils may also be a source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but these reactive trace gases have so far received little attention. Nevertheless, VOCs can i) prolong the lifetime of atmospheric methane, ii) contribute to hazardous ozone production, and iii) lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosols. Consequently, changing VOC emissions may exert significant impacts on climate forcing factors that can both exacerbate or mitigate future climate change. Here, we conducted in situ measurements of soil and pond VOC emissions across an actively degrading permafrost-affected peatland in subarctic Norway. We used a permafrost thaw gradient as a space-for-time substitute that covered bare soil and vegetated peat plateaus, underlain by intact permafrost, and increasingly degraded permafrost landscapes: thaw slumps, thaw ponds, and vegetated thaw ponds. Results showed that every peatland landscape type was an important source of atmospheric VOCs, emitting a large variety of compounds, such as methanol, acetone, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, isoprene, hydrocarbons, and oxygenated VOCs. VOC composition varied considerably across the measurement period and across the permafrost thaw gradient. We observed enhanced terpenoid emissions following thaw slump degradation, highlighting the potential atmospheric impacts of permafrost thaw, due to the high chemical reactivities of terpenoid compounds. Higher VOC emission rates were observed in summer (June, July and August) compared to early autumn (September). Overall, our study dem-onstrates that VOCs are being emitted in significant quantities and with largely similar compositions upon permafrost thawing, inundation, and subsequent vegetation development, despite major differences in micro-climate, hydrological regime, vegetation, and permafrost occurrence.","2023-02","2025-01-14 17:26:05","2025-03-07 18:27:29","","","","","430","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000963592600001","6.1","1","SC: 0000012","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the release of volatile organic compounds from thawing permafrost peatlands and found that they can be a substantial source of VOCs which could exasperate effects of climate change. </p> </div>","","","climate change; peatland; permafrost; permafrost thaw; substrate disturbance; pollution; air pollution; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To understand the potential impact of landscape fragmentation on peatland nutrient stoichiometry, we characterize the stoichiometric ratios of C, N and P in the soil-plant systems of disturbed boreal forest peatlands and also assessed relationships among site conditions, nutrient availability, stoichiometric ratios (C:N:P) and C storage in four sites that represent the forms of disturbed peatlands in the Athabasca oil sands region. Our results showed that nutrient stoichiometric balance differed across and within these peatlands, among plants, peat, and groundwater. Ratios of C:N and C:P in peat is a function of nutrient and moisture conditions, increasing from nutrient-rich (C:N = 28; C:P = 86) to nutrient-poor fens (C:N = 82; C:P = 1061), and were lower in moist hollows relative to drier hummock microforms. In groundwater, the drier nutrient-rich fen had higher N:P ratios relative to the nutrient-poor fen, reflecting interactions between dominant hydrologic conditions and stoichiometric relationships. The N:P ratio of plants was more similar to those of peat than groundwater pools, especially in the most recently disturbed nutrient-poor fen, where plant C:N:P ratios were greater compared to older disturbed sites in the region.

Recent studies, however, have shown that there are habitats in the subarctic tundra emitting N2O at high rates, such as bare peat (BP) surfaces on permafrost peatlands. Nevertheless, the processes behind N2O production in these high-emission habitats are poorly understood. In this study, we established an in situ N-15-labeling experiment with two main objectives: (1) to partition the microbial sources of N2O emitted from BP surfaces on permafrost peatlands and (2) to study the fate of ammonium and nitrate in these soils and in adjacent vegetated peat (VP) surfaces showing low N2O emissions. Our results confirm the hypothesis that denitrification is mostly responsible for the high N2O emissions from BR. During the study period, denitrification contributed similar to 79 % of the total N2O emissions from BP, whereas the contribution from ammonia oxidation was less (about 19 %). Both gross N mineralization and gross nitrification rates were higher in BP than in VP, with high C/N ratios and a low water content likely limiting N transformation processes and, consequently, N2O production in the latter soil type. Our results show that multiple factors contribute to high N2O production in BP surfaces on permafrost peatlands, with the most important factors being the absence of plants, an intermediate to high water content and a low C/N ratio, which all affect the mineral-N availability for soil microbes, including those producing N2O. The process understanding produced here is important for the development of process models that can be used to evaluate future permafrost-N feedbacks to the climate system.","2022-05-31","2025-01-14 17:26:06","2025-03-07 18:27:29","","2683-2698","","10","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000803020300001","4.9","2","SC: 0000014","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the release of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide from permafrost peatlands and conclude that denitrification of mineral nitrogen is the main source of N2O.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; permafrost; permafrost thaw; greenhouse gases; nutrients; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that disturbances and their timing affect plant and bryophyte species richness and other indicators of conservation success. More specifically, we expected conservation status to improve with disturbances that mimic natural grazing processes, that is, that extensive year-round grazing with trampling had a more positive effect than intensive summer grazing or mowing. Location Kastbjerg wetlands, Jutland, Denmark. Methods In a three-year field experiment, we applied trampling, season-specific defoliation with biomass removal and burning in a randomized design in nine wetland sites. We recorded species richness and community composition. Bayesian generalized linear mixed-effects models were built with treatment as fixed effect, site as random effect and species richness or species composition as responses. Leaf N and P, and soil moisture were included as covariables. Further, a quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) was applied to test for discrimination between treatments based on a set of biodiversity indicators. Results Environmental and biotic differences among sites were considerable and significant indicating a considerable effect of historical contingency (local species pool). We found only minor and mostly insignificant effects of disturbance on vegetation. However, a QDA revealed significant differences among treatments based on five indicators for conservation status. Simulated grazing and trampling were generally associated with higher vascular plant richness, bryophyte richness, number of indicator species and stress-tolerant species and decreasing abundance of competitive species. Conclusion We found small, but positive effects of disturbance on biodiversity indicators of wetland vegetation after three years of experimental treatments. Initial site differences explained most variation, indicating strong historical contingency.

Peatland surface motion is a response to changes in the water and gas content of a peat body regulated by the ecology and hydrology of a peatland system. Surface motion is therefore a sensitive measure of ecohydrological condition but has traditionally been impossible to measure at the landscape scale. Here we examine the potential of surface motion metrics derived from satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to map peatland condition in a blanket bog landscape. We show that the timing of maximum seasonal swelling of the peat is characterised by a bimodal distribution. The first maximum, usually in autumn, is typical of ""stiffer"" peat associated with steeper topographic gradients, peatland margins, and degraded peatland and more often associated with ""shrub""-dominated vegetation communities. The second maximum, usually in winter, is typically associated with ""softer"" peat typically found in low topographic gradients often featuring pool systems and Sphagnum-dominated vegetation communities. Specific conditions of ""soft"" and ""stiff' peats are also determined by the amplitude of swelling and multi-annual average motion. Peatland restoration currently follows a re-wetting strategy; however, our approach highlights that landscape setting appears to determine the optimal endpoint for restoration. Aligning the expectation for restoration outcomes with landscape setting might optimise peatland stability and carbon storage. Importantly, deployment of this approach, based on surface motion dynamics, could support peatland mapping and management on a global scale.","2022-03-24","2025-01-14 17:26:06","2025-03-12 18:13:23","","261-277","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000774955400001","3.4","2","SC: 0000039","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of satellite remote sensing to determine the soil moisture in blanket peatlands in the UK.

Altered hydrological regimes may drive changes in the dynamics of microbial mercury (Hg) methylation and bioavailability. Important knowledge gaps remain on the contribution of specific microbial groups to methylmercury (MeHg) production in wetlands of various trophic status. Here, we measured aqueous chemistry, potential methylation rates (k(meth)), volatile fatty acid (VFA) dynamics in peat-soil incubations, and genetic potential for Hg methylation across a groundwater-driven nutrient gradient in an interior Alaskan fen. We tested the hypotheses that (1) nutrient inputs will result in increased methylation potentials, and (2) syntrophic interactions contribute to methylation in subarctic wetlands. We observed that concentrations of nutrients, total Hg, and MeHg, abundance of hgcA genes, and rates of methylation in peat incubations (k(meth)) were highest near the groundwater input and declined downgradient. hgcA sequences near the input were closely related to those from sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), methanogens, and syntrophs. Hg methylation in peat incubations collected near the input source (FPF2) were impacted by the addition of sulfate and some metabolic inhibitors while those down-gradient (FPF5) were not. Sulfate amendment to FPF2 incubations had higher k(meth) relative to unamended controls despite no effect on k(meth) from addition of the sulfate reduction inhibitor molybdate. The addition of the methanogenic inhibitor BES (25 mM) led to the accumulation of VFAs, but unlike molybdate, it did not affect Hg methylation rates. Rather, the concurrent additions of BES and molybdate significantly decreased k(meth), suggesting a role for interactions between SRB and methanogens in Hg methylation. The reduction in k(meth) with combined addition of BES and molybdate, and accumulation of VFA in peat incubations containing BES, and a high abundance of syntroph-related hgcA sequences in peat metagenomes provide evidence for MeHg production by microorganisms growing in syntrophy. Collectively the results suggest that wetland nutrient regimes influence the activity of Hg methylating microorganisms and, consequently, Hg methylation rates. Our results provide key information about microbial Hg methylation and methylating communities under nutrient conditions that are expected to become more common as permafrost soils thaw.","2021-10-04","2025-01-14 17:26:06","2025-03-07 22:07:11","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000717066800001","5.2","2","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of nutrient enrichment on the methylation of mercury in a subarctic peatland. </p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; permafrost; permafrost thaw; microbial activity; nutrients; substrate disturbance; nutrient enrichment; metal/metalloid; cold climate; sulphur compounds; substrate; climate; fertility change/contamination; mercury/methylmercury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But smouldering wildfires are emerging as a global concern because they cause extensive air pollution, emit very large amounts of carbon, are difficult to detect and suppress, and could accelerate climate change. Central to the topic are smouldering peat fires that lead to the largest fires on Earth. Smouldering also dominates the residual burning after flames have died out and firebrand ignition.

Severe peatland wildfires can provide opportunities for new non-peatland species to colonise post fire. Changes in plant colonisation could lead to longer-term shifts in community composition, compromising recovery of peatland structure and function. Understanding the process of post-fire recovery can thus inform restoration action and help restore peatland vascular plant communities. In this study, we ask: what drives initial vascular plant recovery following a peatland wildfire? Location Stalybridge moors, England (commonly referred to as the Saddleworth moors). Methods We used a series of vegetation surveys and seed germination experiments to identify the composition of vascular plant community one-year post fire, along with potential propagule sources. We combined this with plant trait data and, using a series of null models, compared observed community trait values against random species assemblages. Results Our data suggests that plant species are able to arrive at the burned site through multiple non-exclusive recolonisation pathways. This includes colonisation through the soil seed bank, along with dispersal from surrounding unburned peatland and non-peatland vegetation. The composition and structure of the recolonised communities was largely determined by the ability of species to reach the post-fire site from these donor communities. This resulted in a post-fire community composed of species possessing lower seed masses relative to the wider pool of potential colonisers. Conclusions Our results highlight propagule availability as a driver of post-wildfire vascular plant recovery. This provides opportunities for new non-peatland species to colonise, potentially driving changes in the direction of vegetation recovery. Ensuring the availability of peatland species following a wildfire could therefore be key to the immediate recovery of these systems.","2021-07","2025-01-14 17:26:06","2025-03-07 18:20:41","","","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000701239900014","2.8","3","SC: 0000012","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the extent to which peatlands can recover naturally following fire and conclude that active restoration is required to ensure sufficient desirable seed and to limit the potential of colonization by non-native species. </p> </div>","","","fire; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; passive restoration; invasive species; mitigation hierarchy; revegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To restore peat-forming vegetation, drained bogs are being rewetted on a large scale. Although this practice results in higher groundwater levels, unfortunately it often creates deep lakes in parts where peat was extracted to greater depths than the surroundings. Revegetation of these deeper waters by peat mosses appears to be challenging due to strong abiotic feedbacks that keep these systems in an undesired bare state. In this study, we theoretically explore if a floating peat mat and an open human-made bog lake can be considered two alternative stable states using a simple model, and experimentally test in the field whether stable states are present, and whether a state shift can be accomplished using floating biodegradable structures that mimic buoyant peat. We transplanted two peat moss species into these structures (pioneer sp. Sphagnum cuspidatum and later-successional sp. S. palustre) with and without additional organic substrate. Our model suggests that these open human-made bog lakes and floating peat mats can indeed be regarded as alternative stable states. Natural recovery by spontaneous peat moss growth, i.e., a state shift from open water to floating mats, is only possible when the water table is sufficiently shallow to avoid light limitation (<0.29 m at our site). Our experiment revealed that alternative stable states are present and that the floating structures facilitated the growth of pioneer S. cuspidatum and vascular plants. Organic substrate addition particularly facilitated vascular plant growth, which correlated to higher moss height. The structures remained too wet for the late-successional species S. palustre. We conclude that open water and floating peat mats in human-made bog lakes can be considered two alternative stable states, and that temporary floating establishment structures can induce a state shift from the open water state to peat-forming vegetation state. These findings imply that for successful restoration, there is a clear water depth threshold to enable peat moss growth and there is no need for addition of large amounts of donor-peat substrate. Correct species selection for restoration is crucial for success.","2021-09","2025-01-14 17:26:06","2025-03-12 12:54:51","","","","6","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000656185400001","5","1","SC: 0000009","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper tests methods to improve the establishment of sphagnum mosses in restored peatland pools.</p> </div>; <div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper tests thresholds for the establishment of sphagnum during the restoration of pools in ombrotrophic peatlands.</p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; bog; substrate disturbance; drawdown; rewetting; bryophytes; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; pools/ponds; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the main concerns is the development of Hg methylation hotspots in the terrestrial environment due to thermokarst formation.

Here, we have studied the formation of Hg methylation hotspots using existing thaw gradients at five Fennoscandian permafrost peatland sites.

We observed 10 times higher concentrations of MeHg and 13 times higher %MeHg in the collapse fen (representing thawed conditions) as compared to the peat plateau (representing frozen conditions).

The experiments were conducted in the Trent University Environmental Wind Tunnel, Peterborough, Ontario, and on the tailings ponds at a mine near Havelock, Ontario. Treated surfaces were subjected to particle-free airflow, abrasion with blown sand particles, and particle-free airflow after physical disturbance. Emission rates in the wind tunnel tests were calculated from dust concentration measurements obtained in vertical profile with DustTrak (TM) II aerosol monitors (model 8530); rates in the field were measured using a Portable In-Situ Wind Erosion Laboratory (PI-SWERL). In the particle-free wind tunnel tests, three of the surface treatments performed well, and PM(10)emission scaled inversely with crust strength. Light bombardment of each surface by saltating sand grains increased PM(10)emission rates by two orders of magnitude. All treated surfaces emitted significantly more PM(10)after physical disturbance. In the field study, plots treated with a commercial dust suppressant were found to release more PM(10)than either the control or irrigated plots, although it should be noted that the emission rates were similar in magnitude. As in the wind tunnel experiments, all of the field plots became significantly more emissive after physical disturbance. The field results suggest that the site conditions, inclusive of the potential for dust advection and resuspension, must be taken into account when considering the use of a commercial dust suppressant. Implications:Fugitive dust (PM10) emissions from mining and industrial operations worldwide present significant environmental and human health risks, leaving mine operators challenged to find reliable, durable, and cost-effective mitigation options. Commercial dust suppressants boast unique chemical compositions and commensurate particle binding capabilities, although few side-by-side comparisons exist in the literature. The efficacy of four commercial products to suppress PM(10)emissions from mine tailings, before and after physical disturbance, was assessed using robust field and wind tunnel experiments. All surfaces emitted significantly more PM(10)after physical disturbance but with considerable variability amongst products.

In this study, we evaluated the distribution of trace elements in subarctic soils from different land covers at Abisko, northern Sweden: grassland, moor, broad-leaved forest, and peat bog. Using various multivariate analysis approaches, results indicated a spatial heterogeneity with a strong influence of soil horizon classes considered: lithogenic elements (e.g., Al, Cr, Ti) were accumulated in mineral horizon classes and surface process-influenced elements (e.g., Cd, Cu, Se) in organic horizon classes. Atmospheric influences included contamination by both local mines (e.g., Cu, Fe, Ni) and regional or long-range atmospheric transport (e.g.. Cd, Pb, Zn). A non-negative matrix factorization was used to estimate, for each element, the contribution of various sources identified. For the first time, a comparison between geochemical and ecological data was performed to evaluate the influence of vegetation on element distribution. Apart from soil pH that could control dynamics of As, Cu, and Se, two vegetation classes were reported to be correlated to geochemical factors: forbs and shrubs/dwarf shrubs probably due to their annual vs. perennial activities, respectively. Since these are considered as the main vegetation classes that quickly evolve with climate change, we expect to see modifications in trace element biogeochemical cycling in the future.

We performed an independent reanalysis of publicly available AOSR snow pack data to: replicate previous results; to provide new insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of metal and PAC deposition; and, to determine whether certain metals or PACs were associated with specific oil sands mining or upgrading activities. Using PAC ratios, we use a K-means clustering approach to classify snowpack data into two combustion-dominated classes, and three classes associated with oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading. Snow samples dominated by ""oil sands mine"" emissions are consistent with a petrogenic source and exhibited low UNS ratios and high DBT ratios. Snow samples dominated by ""petroleum coke"" emissions had the highest BaP ratios, high DBT ratios, and were collected nearest the upgrader complexes. Metals data indicate snow samples dominated by oil sands mine emissions arc consistent with an Athabasca Sands type composition. Those dominated by emissions from petroleum coke show enrichment of biophile metals V, Ni, and M. We conclude that previous studies have over-estimated environmental loadings of PACs, their spatial extent, and direction of their trend over time. These differences are attributed to the use of arithmetic rather than geometric spatial averaging, use of an arbitrary location (AR6) to determine the extent of metals and PAC deposition, and because previous studies neglected to account for metals and PACs being deposited from non-oil sands sources. Oil sands operators continue to reduce their emissions intensity, however there is an emerging consensus that mitigating fugitive emissions from petroleum coke stockpiles may represent the greatest opportunity to reduce environmental loadings of PACs in the AOSR.","2019-09-10","2025-01-14 17:26:06","2025-02-10 13:43:56","","692-708","","","682","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000471888900068","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reexamines the data on the deposition of metals and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) in the Alberta oil sands regions.

Carbon-rich peatlands cover upwards of 65% of the landscape in northern Canada where resource extraction activities disturb both the carbon pools and the future carbon sequestration capacity of the landscape. Previous estimates of the carbon losses from this disturbance predict a complete loss of the region's peatland carbon pool. Mining industries operating in these sensitive environments have recently begun constructing closure landscapes which are intended to develop carbon cycle processes similar to undisturbed northern peatlands. This study investigates eddy covariance fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) at one of Canada's first fully constructed boreal plains watersheds, the Sandhill Fen Watershed. During the first three years since inception, only the lowland region had an annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) indicative of increasing CO2 sink potential. The lowland region was characterized by saturated salvaged peat soils, standing water, thriving communities of Typha and Carex spp. and was a net CO2 sink of 77 g C m(-2) in the third year. At the same time the upland and the midland regions characterized by moist salvaged peat soils and a mix of herbaceous, shrub and planted Picea glauca and Pinus banksiana remained net sources of CO2. Despite similar rates of gross primary production, ecosystem and plot-level respiration rates in the lowland were significantly lower than in the midland region, likely due to very low reduction potentials within the lowland's saturated soils. With no other significant outflows of carbon, the lowland of the Sandhill Fen Watershed may be in the early stages of organic matter accumulation. Due to limited oxidation of the salvaged peat substrate in the lowland region, wetland reclamation employing these techniques may reduce the disturbance loss of the carbon pool in the boreal plains.","2019-09","2025-01-14 17:26:06","2025-03-08 14:24:17","","116-126","","","135","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000470235100013","3.8","2","SC: 0000017","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the first three years of greenhouse gas emissions from a constructed fen for mine reclamation in the AB oil sands region. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; mining; greenhouse gases; substrate disturbance; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; mine reclamation; mitigation hierarchy; mine planning; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, numerous restoration efforts within degraded bogs have been realized. In many cases, however, it is unknown whether the conservation measures have been successful. We used Odonata (hereafter referred to as dragonflies) as ecological indicators to evaluate the restoration success of rewetting measures in central European degraded raised bogs. Depending on their land-use history (rewetted industrial peat cuts with and without former agricultural use), two types of bog restoration were compared with rural peat cuts (control). Our study demonstrated that restored bogs are important habitats for dragonfly conservation. Both types of restored bogs were as diverse in overall species richness as the control plots. However, land-use history had a strong effect on restoration success. All raised-bog species of the study area were able to recolonize at least some of the nutrient-poor restored bogs. The situation was different for the nutrient-rich restored bogs. Due to the high nutrient content - caused by the former agricultural use - the characteristic dragonfly fauna of raised bogs will be unlikely to be able to recolonize in these locations in the long term. Nevertheless, the nutrient-rich restored bogs represent an important secondary habitat, especially for transition-bog species. In conclusion, the conducted restoration measures created a network of small oligo- to mesotrophic water bodies, which fosters aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity in bogs.","2019-09","2025-01-14 17:26:06","2025-03-07 18:20:43","","291-298","","","237","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000488314700032","5.9","1","SC: 0000017","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the restoration of raised bogs on the dragonfly assemblages of peatland pools.

The organic material interacts with AMD and with the wastes, which leaves imprint on its composition. This interaction produces geochemical anomalies (g/t: 1582 Cu, 41,300 Zn, 6060 Se, 11,700 Hg, 114-155 Au, 534 Ag, 416 I). The contents of elements depend on Fe in three groups of NOM samples that contain <10 wt% Fe (group I), 10-22 wt% Fe (group II), and >22 wt% Fe (group III). NOM with higher Fe enrichment contains less Cu, Zn, Se, Hg, Ag and I, as well as Cd, Ba, Sr and Rb, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Sn, Sb, and Te but more As. Yet, gold may reach high concentrations in NOM with any Fe contents. Accumulation of elements by NOM during its prolonged interaction with wastes and AMD is maintained by physical, chemical, biochemical, and mineralogical processes. They are, respectively, migration of waters controlled by permeability of material in the dispersion train depending on its grain sizes and by AMD flow direction; oxidative dissolution of sulfides, complexing, and adsorption on organic matter and Fe(III) hydroxides; microbial mediation; and secondary mineralization. The chemistry of waters interacting with NOM at the time of its deposition can be reconstructed with regard to several factors, including microbial mediation. Namely, local geochemical anomalies with ultrahigh element concentrations may arise because microorganisms can immobilize Hg to make it less toxic; sulfate-reducing bacteria can maintain precipitation of Zn, Cu, and Cd sulfides; microbial activity can mediate redistribution of elements between clastic and organic materials, etc. The inferred inheritance of AMD geochemical signatures by NOM has implications for the conditions and mechanisms of element accumulation.","2019-04-10","2025-01-14 17:26:06","2025-03-07 22:06:56","","468-483","","","660","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000457725700047","9.8","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the mixing of metal mine tailings with peat to produce acid rock drainage exported from tailings areas in Russia. </p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; mining; peat; pollution; arsenic; tailings; tailings management; copper; zinc; acid rock drainage; water pollution; metal/metalloid; sulphur compounds; substrate; mine planning; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The entomofauna of seven peat pools in a peatbog and its surrounding natural marginal zone in SE Poland was investigated at the level of species, assemblages and faunistic metrics, indicating the key environmental drivers of the insect distribution and their implications for the biodiversity and potential conservation of these habitats. The species composition, specialists, and insect assemblages of the peat pools were linked with the fauna typical of both peatbogs and dystrophic pools with an open water surface. The most specialized fauna was found in the pools with the largest Sphagnum cover: only tyrphobionts, of all the ecological elements, significantly discriminated the fauna of peat pools and the marginal zone. Sphagnum cover was the key structural factor affecting the distribution of all the insects. Additionally, dragonflies were dependent on pH, beetles on temperature, and caddisflies on dissolved oxygen; however, structural factors-apart from Sphagnum cover-pool perimeter and emergent vegetation cover were predominant. Our results show that appropriate management of the structural factors of peat pools, especially Sphagnum cover, and the provision of different successional stages, can enhance biodiversity and help to maintain a valuable specialist fauna. Even along small environmental gradients and in a homogeneous area, the response of insects is highly differentiated.

Most new projects are required to identify performance standards to evaluate restoration outcomes. Current performance standards are primarily related to vegetation with little to no evaluation of wetland hydrologic regimes. Because of the agreement in the scientific literature about the role of hydrology in creating and maintaining wetland structure and function, hydrologic performance standards may be an ecologically meaningful way to evaluate restoration outcomes. This research tests the use of water level data from project specific reference sites to evaluate restored water levels for three distinct wetland types across the United States. We analyzed existing datasets from past and ongoing wetland mitigation projects to identify the number of years it took water levels in restored wetlands to match reference sites, and to test whether similar water levels between restored and reference sites leads to increased vegetation success. Wetland types differed in the number of years it took for water levels to match reference sites. Vernal pools in California took nine years to match reference sites, fens and wet meadows in Colorado took four years, and forested wetlands in the southeastern US were hydrologically similar to reference sites the first year following restoration. Plant species cover in all three restored wetland types was related to the water level similarity to reference sites. Native cover was higher when water levels were more similar to reference sites, and was lower in areas where water levels were different. Exotic species cover showed the opposite relationship in fens and wet meadows, where hydrologic similarity led to low cover of exotic species. Along with the general agreement of the importance of hydrology for wetland form and function, this research shows that hydrologic performance standards may also lead to increased vegetation success in some wetland types.","2019-02-01","2025-01-14 17:26:06","2025-03-12 01:48:49","","1154-1163","","","231","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000456641100124","8.7","1","SC: 0000017","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the hydrological criteria to assess success of wetland restoration or wetland offsetting in the United States.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; other wetland; water table; monitoring; offsetting; invasive species; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In many cases, however, seeds of target wild species must be collected from natural populations and then stored in proper conditions until re-introduction. Peatland pool margin specialists rarely recolonize their habitat once a peatland is restored following peat extraction and therefore must be actively reintroduced. However, little is known about the storage conditions promoting seed viability. In this context, we investigated the effects of four storage conditions on the seed viability of eight species collected from natural peatland pool margins of eastern Canada: 1) room temperature, dry conditions, 2) cold temperature, dry conditions, 3) cold temperature, moist conditions, and 4) cold temperature, submerged. Seeds stored for one year were periodically (3, 6, 12 months) tested for viability using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Seed viability decreased after storage for four of the eight species investigated (Carex echinata, C. magellanica, C. oligosperma, and C. pauciflora) and increased for Rhynchospora alba, but did not vary significantly following storage for C. limosa and Scheuchzeria palustris. Furthermore, the viability of Drosera intermedia and Rhynchospora alba seeds was higher when stored in dry conditions relative to moist or submerged conditions. Proper Seed storage conditions are thus highly species-dependent. Direct sowing after collection should be preferred for most of the Carex species, while seeds of Scheuchzeria palustris, Drosera intermedia and Rhynchospora alba could be stored, preferably in dry conditions, without impacting introduction success due to reduced seed viability.","2019-01","2025-01-14 17:26:07","2025-03-12 01:42:49","","59-63","","","152","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000453490500010","1.8","3","SC: 0000008","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the seed storage behaviour of plant species that could be used to restore more diverse vascular plant communities around constructed pools in restored peatlands.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; active restoration; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; revegetation; pools/ponds; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Addressing these concerns will require industries reliant on natural resources from the boreal zone to innovate their processes, management, and infrastructure to improve extraction efficiency while contributing to society's increasing expectations related to sustainability. Here, we explore past, current, and future trends in industrial innovation and infrastructure in the boreal zone for forestry, mining, pulp and paper, oil and gas, and renewable sources of power generation. We assess the role of innovation on the future socio-ecological state of the boreal zone by considering interactions between innovation in industry and infrastructure and other key drivers of change in the boreal, such as atmospheric changes, changing demands for nonprovisioning and provisioning ecosystem services, governance, and demographics and social values. We present future scenarios highlighting three divergent trajectories of change in boreal ecosystems based on past and current states of innovation in industry and infrastructure.

Economic interest in this region has recently increased due to the discovery of vast mineral deposits (mainly chromite and nickel) known as the ""Ring of Fire''. Mineral exploration and infrastructure planning are underway, but environmental monitoring is only beginning. Detailed baseline ecological information is required to assess the impacts of future resource extraction within the context of multiple environmental stressors (including recent regional climate warming). Here we use sediment cores from two relatively deep lakes (Z(max) similar to 10 m) and two shallow lakes (Z(max) similar to 2 m), all located in the vicinity of the Ring of Fire, to examine biotic responses to warming prior to the commencement of mining activities. Our data show that, over the past similar to 150 years, diatom and cladoceran sedimentary assemblages have transitioned from dominance by littoral/benthic forms to greater abundances of planktonic cladoceran (an increase of similar to 3 to 34 %) and diatom taxa (an increase of similar to 3 to 22 %). Increased relative abundances of planktonic taxa are consistent with warming-induced changes in lake properties including longer ice-free periods and increased production by planktonic algae. The response of diatom assemblages in shallow lakes to warming preceded the deeper lakes by similar to 45 to 60 years, and substantial increases in aquatic production (similar to 4 to 15 times higher than in sediments deposited prior to 1900) were observed in the shallow lakes, in agreement with previous analyses demonstrating the heightened sensitivity of shallow systems to climate warming. These data provide important information necessary to distinguish potential ecological impacts related to resource extraction from natural variation and the ongoing responses to regional climate warming.","2016-10","2025-01-15 14:52:40","2025-03-12 01:56:44","2016-10-01","153-172","","2-3","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000383989300005","2.1","3","SC: 0000015  Ontario Minist Environm & Climate Change","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper uses a paleoecological approach to set baseline environmental conditions in the central Hudson Bay Lowland.

The reclamation field trial examines eight amendment treatment combinations that include treatments with a winter kill cover crop of oats, fertilizer, biosolids, peat, and combinations thereof. The objectives of this study are to: (1) Investigate how soil amendments influence plant functional group establishment and growth in mine overburden; and (2) Explore the amendment properties that best support the establishment and growth of a plant community that resembles the baseline reference sites. Currently, the presence of non-native species and a dominant woody plant community explains the largest proportion of variance between the forested upland and lowland reference sites and all reclaimed sites. Similar to non-native species, graminoids were absent from the upland forested reference sites. The difference in the graminoid community explains much of the variance between the forested reference sites and all reclaimed sites. The cumulative additions of fertilizer and peat increased alpha diversity of non-native and graminoid plants within the amendment treatments, which had greater alpha diversity of these plant functional groups than the forested reference sites. Within the amendment treatments, non-native and graminoid alpha diversity was initially greater in the nutrient treatments, but by 2019 there was no significant difference in non-native or graminoid alpha diversity between amendment treatments. The results indicate that applications of nutrients through fertilizer or biosolids may increase graminoid alpha diversity and abundance within reclamation units in year 1. The results also confirm that the vascular plant community composition present within the historically reclaimed sites and amendment treatments does not resemble the forested reference sites. The plant community present within the amendment treatment sites is best described as early successional, with the presence of non-native herbaceous legumes dominating the historically reclaimed sites. Despite this, the results indicate that fertilizer and biosolids-based treatments have developed a vascular plant community, excluding woody species that is more similar to the forested reference sites than the peat-based treatments. Further research and long-term monitoring are needed to determine which amendment treatment will best support a plant community that resembles the forested reference sites. In addition, future studies of this nature might consider including wildfire affected and post-harvested forest stands as additional reference sites, to better capture possible plant community trajectories of a severely disturbed environment.","2021-06","2025-01-15 16:07:22","2025-03-07 18:27:48","","","","6","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000665996900001","2.9","2","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents the results of restoration trials for mine reclamation at the Detour Lake Mine in the Hudson Bay Lowland.

The sulfur content of the waste rock ranged from 0 to 2.2 wt %, with pyrite and pyrrhotite identified as the principal sulfide minerals. Acidity released through sulfide oxidation in the WRS has been neutralized through carbonate mineral dissolution, and has resulted in the generation of neutral mine drainage (pH 6-8). However, the WRS is heterogeneous, and localized water samples collected from discrete zones within the stockpile were more highly oxidized and acidic (i.e., pH >= 2.5). Enumerations of acidophilic sulfur- (aSOM) and iron-oxidizing microorganisms (aI0M) were performed, yielding mean abundances of 1.2 x 10(3) and 9.0 x 10(5) cells g(-1), respectively. The mean abundance of neutrophilic sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms (nSOM) was 5.5 x 10(5) cells g(-1). Fungi and bacteria present in the waste rock were identified using high-throughput amplicon sequencing of 18S and 16S rRNA genes, respectively. Sequencing confirmed the presence of Thiobacillus and Acidithiobacillus species. Bacterial diversity was greatest in samples from the cover material. Unoxidized waste rock samples were characterized by neutrophilic iron- or sulfur-oxidizing genera (i.e., Thiobacillus), whereas samples collected from oxidized and acidic zones in the WRS showed greater abundances of acidophilic taxa (i.e., Acidithiobacillus). None of the fungal genera identified in this study have been shown to oxidize sulfide minerals directly, other than indirectly through creation of a suitable environment for the prokaryotes involved in the processes. Although installation of a simple, non-engineered cover is anticipated to have slowed the generation of ARD, evidence of ongoing sulfide oxidation within the covered WRS was observed. High abundances and activities of sulfur- and iron-oxidizing microorganisms indicate that the soil cover has not prevented the growth of microorganisms that catalyze sulfide-mineral oxidation.","2020-03","2025-01-15 16:07:23","2025-03-07 18:27:48","","","","","114","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000518403400012","3.4","3","SC: 0000013","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the microbial communities within waste rock at the Detour Lake Mine in the HBL to determine the extent of potential acid rock generation.

The microfabric of the cured mixtures was investigated with mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The mixture samples were prepared at their maximum dry unit weight and optimum moisture content. Effect of adding fly ash to gold tailings (i.e., 0, 20, and 40% of the dry weight of tailings) was examined, and a comparison was made on samples prepared at the same fly ash content by replacing gold tailings with humic acid (i.e., gold tailings and humic acid ratios of 100:0, 90:10, and 80:20 by weight) or by varying pore fluid chemistry (i.e., water and salt solutions of 1 M NaCl and CaCl2). The results show that the initial thermal conductivity of the samples is sensitive to the mixture proportion and a declination in the thermal conductivity is observed due to hydration of fly ash and evaporation. Inclusion of fly ash and salts into gold tailings improves the unconfined compressive strength but the presence of humic acid in samples leads to the decrease of the strength.

Most of the inflow to the wells comes from a limited number of discrete zones in the carbonate rocks, resulting in low hydraulic efficiencies. The variable hydrogeologic conditions require efficient pumping over a wide range of yields and lifts, and there are logistical issues associated with the isolated setting and the extreme cold winter temperatures. The hydrogeology of the Victor mine area was characterised over three winter field seasons using packer tests, pumping tests, step-drawdown tests, and downhole logging to define the lateral and vertical variation in the hydraulic conductivity of the carbonate aquifer. Based on these data, wells were designed and submersible pumps with variable frequency drives were installed. Two 3-D numerical groundwater flow models were constructed, one a 'sub-regional' model to provide input to the mine feasibility study and permitting process and the other a near-pit 'window' model to simulate groundwater conditions in the immediate vicinity of the mine. These models are used in tandem to direct design of the dewatering system, evaluate its effectiveness, and to predict long-term environmental effects.","2010-06","2025-01-15 16:07:23","2025-03-07 18:27:29","","99-107","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000282739200004","2.8","4","SC: 0000026","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the dewatering of the De Beers Victor Mine in the Hudson Bay Lowland and discusses challenges.

The acid-base accounting (ABA) results indicated that the fly ash possessed strong alkaline (neutralization) potential (NP) and could be used in the management of reactive mine tailings, thus ensuring prevention of AMD in the long-term. Column tests conducted in the laboratory to further investigate long-term performance of fly ash in the neutralization and prevention of acid mine drainage from tailings similarly showed that mixing fly ash with mine tailings reduces dissolution of many heavy metals from tailings by providing alkalinity to the system.

However, there are still many regions and locations where Hg monitoring is limited or non-existent. Expansion of the atmospheric Hg monitoring network could be facilitated by the use of cost-effective monitoring methods. As such, biomonitoring and passive monitoring offer a unique alternative to well-established monitoring by active measurements, since they do not require a power supply and require minimal workload to operate. The use of biomonitoring (lichens and mosses) and passive air samplers (PASs) (various designs with synthetic materials) has been reported in the literature, and comparisons with active measurement methods have also been made. However, these studies compared either biomonitoring or PASs (not both) to only one type of active measurement. In our work, we used transplanted (7 sampling sites) and in situ lichens (8 sampling sites) for biomonitoring, two PASs from different producers (3 sampling sites), and two different active measurement types (continuous and discontinuous active measurements, 1 and 8 sampling sites, respectively) to evaluate their effectiveness as monitoring methods. In the 9-month sampling campaign, 3 sampling locations with different characteristics (unpolluted, vicinity of a cement plant, and vicinity of a former Hg mine) were used. The results obtained with lichens and PASs clearly distinguished between sampling locations with different Hg concentrations; using both PASs and lichens together increased the confidence of our observations. The present work shows that biomonitoring and passive sampling can be effectively used to identify areas with elevated atmospheric Hg concentrations. The same can be said for discontinuous active measurements; however, the discrepancy between atmospheric Hg concentrations derived from PASs and discontinuous active measurements should be further investigated in the future.","2024-05-14","2025-01-15 16:24:40","2025-03-07 18:21:45","2024-05-30","35800-35810","","24","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","MEDLINE:38740686","","","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- &nbsp;This paper compares standard active and passive sampling of mercury in the air to lichens as biomonitoring tools.

Many biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the photoreduction and phytovolatilization of Hg from terrestrial ecosystems, and the assessment of deposition and volatilization fluxes is very challenging. Mosses and lichens are widespread in nature and constitute the dominant vegetation in alpine and polar ecosystems. This review surveys the results of Hg biomonitoring with cryptogams in areas with different Hg sources and deposition processes. Lichen and moss ecophysiology, and factors affecting Hg uptake and bioaccumulation are discussed. Although some laboratory experiments indicate a linear accumulation of Hg in cryptogams exposed to Hg degrees, without any significant release, in nature the Hg accumulated in cryptogams is in a dynamic equilibrium with Hg in air and decreases when organisms are transplanted to clean environments. Mercury concentrations in mosses and lichens have often been used to estimate concentrations and deposition fluxes of atmospheric Hg; however, Hg degrees exchanges between cryptogams and air, and the time necessary for mosses and lichens to equilibrate elemental composition with changing atmospheric chemistry, preclude reliable estimates. Biological processes of Hg uptake and exchange with air cannot be reproduced by mechanical collectors, and comparisons between Hg concentrations in biomonitors and those in atmospheric deposition are scarcely reliable. However, the Hg biomonitoring with mosses and lichens is easy and cheap and allows to locate ""hot spots"" of natural or anthropogenic emissions and to assess spatio-temporal changes in Hg deposition patterns. Climate change is affecting the global Hg cycle through the melting of sea-ice in coastal Polar Regions, and modifying Hg sequestration in mountain ecosystems. Despite limitations, large-scale monitoring of Hg with mosses and lichens may be used as a tool to evaluate the impact of global processes in remote ecosystems.","2016-12-01","2025-01-15 16:24:40","2025-03-12 01:56:31","2016-12-07","216-231","","","572","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000387807200023","9.8","1","SC: 0000169","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the use of lichens and mosses as biomonitors to follow changes in mercury deposition.

The researcher dealing with biomonitoring faces many difficulties; for example, in the use of lichens, those of similar composition are not easy to find, because of the differences caused by the tree on which the lichens are growing. Also, terrestrial moss is not always a good choice because of variations in its composition caused by the area it is growing on. The ""bag"" technique seems to be suitable in many cases because it gives the possibility of comparing wet and dry deposition and there are no differences in its content at the beginning of research. The bag construction should be made to keep the humidity of the sample stable to avoid its drying. For a complete and informative data set the biomonitor content should be compared with precipitation, particulate matter fractionation, and speciation data and also with medical statistics to evaluate the correlation between the amount of pollutants in the atmosphere and the human reaction to them.

Lichen biodiversity reflected the impact of the copper-mine dust emissions which were more widespread towards the east, correlated with wind direction and frequency. The chemical analysis of R. fastigiata collected at different distances and in different directions from the mine showed that Cu, K and Mg were derived from the centre of the mine site, confirming thus as the major source of atmospheric dust. Total inhibition of PSII photochemical reactions occurred in R. fastigiata both under field and controlled conditions, when intracellular Cu concentrations exceeded a threshold of approximately 2.0 mu mol g(-1). No samples of this species were found under field conditions beyond the Cu threshold. Thus, the fluorescence parameter F(v)/F(m) proved to be a good estimator of the survival capacity of R. fastigiata under field conditions and thus a useful parameter in determining the sensitivity of the lichens (photobiont) to Cu pollution. The intracellular location of Cu allowed an explanation of the physiological changes and the survival of the species in the surroundings of the copper-mine.","1999-07-15","2025-01-15 16:24:40","2025-03-12 01:56:33","1999-07-15","67-77","","1-2","232","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000082101300009","9.8","1","SC: 0000148","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of lichens as biomonitors to follow air pollution from a copper mine in Portugal.

A significant percentage of the remediation liabilities faced by AANDC are associated with abandoned mines. Of these mine-related liabilities, a significant number involve the need to construct soil (earthen) covers over reactive tailings and waste rock.  AANDC anticipates that they will implement cover systems at some sites within the next two years. To do so they require additional information on key physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect long-term risk to these cover systems. The appropriate design and long- term effectiveness of earthen covers in cold regions is of central importance to AANDC, as well as to local and regional stakeholders.  The Mine Environment Neutral Drainage program recently completed a Phase 1 review of soil covers on mine wastes in cold regions (MEND 1.61.5a, 2009). Several dozen cold regions processes were identified as potentially important for earthen covers. These effects can develop slowly and may not be immediately evident, but could have significant influence on performance over the operating life of a cover system.  The immediate need of AANDC is for guidance on design of new cover systems at abandoned mine sites in cold regions. To this end, AANDC formed a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) comprised of experts in various fields important to cold region cover system design, to provide advice in the completion of this Guidance Document.  This Guidance Document outlines the current state-of-knowledge of soil cover system design in cold regions, the expectations of AANDC on how a cover system design should be conducted, and a summary of information AANDC expects to receive during the design process so that an informed decision can be made on the preferred design. The information presented in this document is intended to support development of designs associated with closure of abandoned mines, but will also be useful in developing closure plans for operational mines in cold regions.  This is a technical document that fits within the framework of sustainability, including socio- economic and socio-environmental aspects of mine closure. The target audience for this document is AANDC project managers and cover system design practitioners associated with closure and reclamation of mine sites in cold regions (In Canada, cold regions are generally considered those north of 60 degrees, though applicable to any location experiencing significant ground frost). Other groups, such as regulatory agencies, Aboriginal peoples, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), may find this document of assistance during their review of a proposed design. It is intended to be a resource for guiding cover system designers in evaluating a wide range of possible solutions. AANDC encourages practitioners to consider that when all issues of long-term performance and liability are considered, the lowest cost option for a cold region cover system may not be the ‘best’ alternative.  This Guidance Document describes key attributes of cold regions and the associated challenges of cover system design in these climates. Cover system design is described beginning with an overview of the philosophy of cover system design, basic theory and fundamental concepts, available cover system design alternatives and their pros and cons, and presents a methodology for applying the tools required to meet cover design objectives. At the end of the document, three case studies are presented to illustrate the practical application of cover system design in cold regions","2012","2025-01-15 16:42:12","2025-03-12 01:48:49","","","","","","","","","","","","MEND 1.61.5c","Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada and MEND","","","","","","","","","SC: 0000001","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This report presents the best management practices for the design of cold climate cover systems over acid generating tailings or waste rock to avoid acid rock drainage.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; best management practices; on-site restoration; mining; mineral processing; pollution; impact minimization; mine reclamation; mitigation hierarchy; acid rock drainage; water pollution; cold climate; climate; mine planning; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explore the challenges in using this framework to achieve global conservation goals, including operationalization and monitoring and compliance, and we discuss solutions and research priorities.

Due to variability in peat thickness across a large and heterogeneous landscape, the existing carbon (C) storage estimates for the HBL may contain large uncertainty. Here, we use geospatial variables that are associated with HBL peat formation, age, accumulation, and occurrence to understand the driving factors for peat depth variability and map peat depth and C storage at 30 m spatial resolution. The estimated average peat depth of HBL is 184(±48) cm with 90% of values falling between 89 and 264 cm. Based on the spatially explicit peat depth, the HBL total C storage is estimated to be 30(±6) Pg. Distance to the coastline is the most important indicator of peat depth where the depth increases with distance further away from Hudson Bay coastline, confirming that the time since peat formation is closely related to peat depth.","2025-01-28","2025-01-22 14:00:01","2025-03-12 01:56:43","2025-01-22","e2024GL110679","","2","52","","Geophysical Research Letters","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.2","1","SC: 0000000  Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper summarizes a survey of the carbon and peat depth in the Hudson Bay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; peat; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; Hudson Bay Lowland; substrate; carbon storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The soil properties of the near-surface peat can give a first understanding of this process. Therefore, we sampled pH value, total organic carbon content (TOC), total nitrogen content (TN), C/N ratio as well as dry bulk density (BD), and describe the structure of near-surface peats in six restored fens in North-East Germany before (2002–2004) and after (2019–2021) restoration. Before restoration, the study sites showed peat degradation to various extents in their near-surface peats. pH values remained relatively stable over time. Comparing the degraded peat horizons, TOC increased significantly in four study sites, ranging from 35.7% to 47.8% in 2002–2004 and from 42.5% to 54.0% in 2019–2021. TN varied from 1.5% to 3.5% in 2002–2004 and from 1.8% to 3.2% in 2019–2021, but changes were only significant in one site, showing a slight decrease. In three sites, the increase in C/N ratio was significant, indicating lower nutrient availability. BD ranged from 0.08 to 0.48 g/cm3 in 2002–2004 and from 0.10 to 0.16 g/cm3 in 2019–2021, decreasing significantly in four sites. The structure of the degraded peat horizons changed after restoration to a more homogenous, sludge mass with larger re-aggregates. In three sites, new peat moss peat layers above the degraded soil horizon were present in 2019–2021, with a mean thickness of 6.8 to 36.1 cm. The structure was comparable to typical, slightly decomposed peat moss peat. Our findings suggest that within about 17 years after fen restoration, and thereby a water table rise close to surface, TOC of the near-surface peats increased to values that are typical for undisturbed peatlands. This indicates that restoration can lead to the re-establishment of peatlands as potential carbon sinks, with TOC within the near-surface peat as one key factor in this process. Further, we assume that the decrease in nutrient availability, decrease of BD, and new, undisturbed peat layers can favor the establishment of mire-specific biodiversity and support ecosystem services similar to near-natural mires.","2024-04-18","2025-01-23 18:44:01","2025-03-12 01:43:34","","e17113","","","12","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.7","3","SC: 0000001","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the properties of peats before and after restoration of fens in Germany and point to the carbon sequestration within 17 years after restoration. </p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; on-site restoration; peat; nutrients; substrate disturbance; pH; carbon sequestration; rewetting; carbon cycle; fen; mitigation hierarchy; substrate; hydrological management; peat/moss extraction","","Karabiniuk, Mykola","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed methodologies to quantify ecosystem services before and after rewetting with a focus on greenhouse gas emissions, water quality, evaporative cooling and mire-typical biodiversity. Both standard and premium approaches to assess these services were developed, and tested in the rewetted polder Kieve (NE-Germany). The standard approaches are default tier 1 estimation procedures, which require little time and few, mainly vegetation data. Based on the Greenhouse gas Emission Site Type (GEST) approach, emissions decreased from 1,306 t CO2e in the baseline scenario to 532 t CO2e in the project scenario, whereas 5 years after rewetting they were assessed to be 543 t CO2e per year. Nitrate release assessed via Nitrogen Emission Site Types (NEST) was estimated to decrease from 1,088 kg N (baseline) to 359 kg N (project), and appeared to be 309 kg N per year 5 years after rewetting. The heat flux − determined with Evapotranspiration Energy Site Types (EEST) – decreased from 6,691 kW (baseline) to 1,926 kW (project), and was 2,250 kW per year 5 years after rewetting. Mire-specific biodiversity was estimated to increase from very low (baseline) to high (project), but was only low 5 years after rewetting. The premium approaches allow quantifying a particular ecosystem service with higher accuracy by measuring or modelling. The approaches presented here have been elaborated for North-Germany but can be adapted for other regions. We encourage scientists to use our research as a model for assessing peatland ecosystem services including biodiversity in other geographical regions. Using vegetation mapping and indicator values derived from meta-analyses is a cost-efficient and robust approach to inform payment for ecosystem services schemes and to support conservation planning at regional to global scales.","2024-06-01","2025-01-23 18:51:39","2025-03-07 18:20:42","","112048","","","163","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","6.9","2","SC: 0000005","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents indicators to monitor ecosystem services provided by peatlands following rewetting to evaluate restoration success. </p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; best management practices; on-site restoration; vegetation; nutrients; rewetting; monitoring; mitigation hierarchy; ecosystem services; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess mire-specific biodiversity, indicators that represent and value all of these characteristics are needed. In this study, we present a system of such indicators for the example of north-east Germany. Our indicators encompass different levels of mire-specific biodiversity and enable an overall assessment. We place special emphasis on high user-friendliness. The attributes considered have been well researched in the study area. Based on data from 30 study sites, we developed scales for rating mire-specific biodiversity in six categories. To evaluate the indicator system, we compared the assessment of selected peatlands via the indicator system with the assessments of experts and practitioners in peatland research and management. This evaluation showed high correspondence. We also demonstrate the use of the indicator system as a practical tool for assessing the effects of peatland restoration, and provide suggestions for its application in other geographical regions.","2022","2025-01-23 18:53:23","2025-10-02 14:10:59","","","","","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000875725800001","1.2","4","SC: 0000013","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents an indicator approach to evaluate the biodiversity of peatlands in Germany.

Increasing encroachment of the forest and petroleum industries into the southern regions of the boreal woodland caribou range has highlighted the need for detailed habitat analysis for this species. We obtained approximately 1000 locations of 47 woodland caribou fitted with very high frequency telemetry collars, providing data on winter habitat use from 1991 to 1994. Telemetry data were combined with digital peatland coverages that best represented lowland habitat diversity. Woodland caribon selected forested fen peatland complexes at both the population and individual spatial scales. Woodland caribou concentrated feeding activity in forested, raised bog islands. The raised bogs provide more xeric substrate for increased lichen biomass, possibly a key factor in their selection during winter. The hypothesized connection between discontinuous permafrost and the maintenance of raised bog islands in terms of caribou forage distribution and availability is discussed.","1995-08","2025-01-23 19:24:35","2025-03-12 01:49:49","","1567-1574","","8","73","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1995TE20400023","","","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the winter habitat of woodland caribou in northern Alberta.

Peatland bird species contrasted increasingly with regional avifauna from north to south or from undisturbed to managed landscapes. Of the 17 bird species found significantly more often in peatlands than in surroundings, some preferred peatlands in the whole study area and others preferred peatlands only in particular regions. Peatland avifaunas within regions were more similar to each other than to their regional avifauna, and differences between regions probably reflected changes in peatland physiognomy.

Edge effects resulting from these linear disturbances can increase their footprint and affect wildlife habitat, including the quality and quantity of plant and lichen forage. In 2012, seismic line restoration became a priority in Alberta, under the realm of restoration of habitat of threatened boreal woodland caribou. More accurate understanding of biotic and abiotic interactions leading to edge effects can be important in choosing appropriate restoration practices and prompting natural regeneration. We assessed the extent of edge effects of seismic lines on the adjacent boreal peatland near Peace River, northwestern Alberta. We compared plant and lichen community composition and environmental conditions on seismic lines and along 22 transects, which extended perpendicularly 75 m into the peatland from both lines edges. Soil moisture and light were higher on the lines, but frozen ground was less frequent than in the adjacent peatland. Seismic lines were also subsided by approximately 1.2 cm. Lichens were less abundant in the 2-25 m zone from the edge-indicating edge effects. On the lines, Sphagnum constituted a nearly 100% cover while lichens, trees, herbs, and other bryophytes were less abundant than in the peatland. We demonstrate how knowledge of edge effects on plants and lichens could be applied in assessing caribou habitat quality based on forage availability and predation risk, and how such knowledge could inform restoration practices of seismic lines in peatlands.","2022-04","2025-01-23 19:24:35","2025-03-12 01:55:17","","","","4","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000673988900001","3.2","2","SC: 0000016","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This study examines the environmental conditions and vegetation of seismic lines in the oil sands region of Alberta and points to the challenges of restoring these sites.</p> </div>","","","Canada; species-at-risk; hydrology; linear disturbance; on-site restoration; seismic lines; vegetation; soil moisture; bryophytes; sphagnum; caribou; caribou, boreal population; mitigation hierarchy; lichens; fauna; mammals; vegetation disturbance; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite increasing awareness of the conservation value of peatlands, the statuses and ecological requirements of peat land species have remained largely understudied. Here, we first analysed temporal trends of Northern European peatland birds to document the status of their populations using bird data from five different countries. Second, we used Finnish monitoring data to assess habitat preferences of peatland bird species, hence helping to target conservation to the most relevant habitat types. There was a general decline of 40% in Northern European peatland bird population sizes in 1981-2014 (speed of decline 1.5%/year) largely driven by Finland, where populations declined almost 50% (2.0% annual decline). In Sweden and Norway, peatland bird populations declined by 20% during 1997-2014 (1.0% annual decline). In contrast, southern populations in Estonia and Latvia, where the majority of open peatlands are protected, showed a 40% increase during 1981-2014 (1.0% annual increase). The most important habitat characteristics preferred by common peatland species in Finland were openness and low tree height, while wetness proved to be an important feature for waders. Drainage of peatlands had clear negative effects on the densities of many species, with the only exception of rustic bunting, which specializes on edge habitats. Our findings call for more effective conservation actions in Northern European peatland habitats, especially in Finland where peatland drainage represents a major threat to biodiversity.","2017-10","2025-01-23 19:24:35","2025-03-07 18:27:35","","223-232","","","214","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000412788100024","5.9","1","SC: 0000074","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper relates the decline of peatland bird species to peatland drainage in northern Europe.</p> </div>","","","peatland; bog; drawdown; fen; migratory birds; fauna; shorebird; birds; pools/ponds; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fecal pellets were collected from live animals for a period of 15 years at various locations in the Netherlands. A total of 535 pellets were successfully analyzed by microscopy and an additional 160 pellets by DNA metabarcoding. Morphological and molecular analyses showed that the diet of pregnant and lactating pond bats differed significantly from the diet of females with no reproductive investment. Further analyses of the data showed that pregnant female pond bats are highly dependent on small prey and pupae, mainly nonbiting midges and mosquitoes (Diptera: Chironomidae and Culicidae). These insects can be found in large quantities in peatlands intersected with shallow waterways, the habitat type in which female pond bats were observed more often than males. Our results suggest that during pregnancy the spatial segregation of sexes coincides with sex-specific diets, which might reflect habitat selection based on energy requirements, in addition to lowered intraspecific competition. When pregnant or lactating, female pond bats occur mainly in peatland with shallow waterways, separate from males. Morphological and molecular analyses of fecal pellets show that this spatial segregation of sexes coincides with sex-specific diets-pregnant females highly depend on small, abundant prey like nonbiting midges and mosquitoes, which might reflect habitat selection based on energy requirements.","2023-12-05","2025-01-23 19:24:35","2025-03-07 18:27:48","","1191-1204","","6","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001083073600001","1.7","3","SC: 0000005","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of peatland habitats by a northern Eurasian bat species and found that pregnant females favour areas above peatland pools where smaller insect prey are found.</p> </div>","","","peatland; arthropods; fauna; mammals; bats; pools/ponds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations have declined across most of North America. Wolf (Canis lupus) predation on adults is partially responsible for declines; however, caribou declines also can be attributed to low calf survival. Wolves and invading coyotes (C. latrans) may contribute to mortality of calves. Aim. We assessed wolf and coyote food habits and population and individual level selection for caribou-preferred habitats (bogs and fens) during the caribou calving season (15 April to 30 June) in north-eastern Alberta, Canada, to determine what role these predators might play as a mortality factor for caribou calves. Methods. We deployed global positioning system and very high-frequency (VHF) radio-collars on 32 wolves and nine coyotes in January 2006 - January 2008, and VHF collars on 42 adult female caribou individuals in 2003-08. We assessed wolf and coyote habitat selection using used-available resource-selection functions, and spatial overlap of wolves and coyotes with caribou using logistic regression to estimate coefficients for latent selection-difference functions. We collected and analysed scats to assess wolf and coyote food habits. Key results. Wolves generally avoided caribou-preferred habitats, particularly bogs. Most coyotes selected caribou-preferred habitats (bogs and/or fens); however, relative to caribou, they were found closer to upland forests. Hair from adult and calf caribou was uncommon in wolf and coyote diet and caribou is likely to be an uncommon alternative prey for these predators. Conclusions. We found that >25% of wolf packs and most coyotes selected caribou-preferred habitats during the calving season. Although caribou was not an important prey, limited secondary predation, by these predators and black bears (Ursus americanus), on adult and calf caribou is likely to be contributing to caribou population declines. Implications. We caution that predation on caribou is likely to escalate as coyotes expand into this region and increasing human disturbance continues to create habitat for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), which is an important prey for both wolves and coyotes.","2013","2025-01-23 19:24:35","2025-03-12 01:49:52","","250-260","","3","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000319470500009","1.9","3","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the overlap of wolves and coyotes with caribou in bogs and fens in northern Alberta.

Predation by wolves (Canis lupus) is believed to be the main proximate cause of these declines. However, it has been hypothesized that recent forestry and energy sector activity in caribou range ultimately might have caused population declines by altering wolf-caribou relationships. We tested the hypothesis that industrial linear features influence wolf movements in woodland caribou range in northeastern Alberta, resulting in increased wolf-caused caribou mortalities close to these features. Using step selection functions (SSF) and observed vs. simulated wolf movement paths, we found that wolf movement was influenced by natural linear features (rivers and streams) throughout the year, possibly because they provide ease of travel and high prey abundance. Wolf movement was further influenced by industrial linear features, but use of these features differed depending on line-type and season. Wolves showed strong selection for steps closer to conventional seismic lines during the snow-free season. Likewise, observed wolf movement paths followed conventional seismic lines more closely than simulated paths during snow-free months. Use of seismic lines as movement corridors might result in wolves hunting in caribou-preferred habitats (bogs and fens) more frequently than they did historically, particularly in the snow-free season when most caribou mortalities occur. However, we found no evidence that caribou mortalities occurred closer to industrial linear features than did live caribou. We conclude that wolf use of seismic lines increases predation risk for caribou close to these features, resulting in caribou avoidance of linear developments and thus functional loss of otherwise suitable habitat for caribou.","2011-12","2025-01-23 19:24:35","2025-03-12 01:49:51","","2854-2865","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000299166300002","5","1","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that linear disturbances through peatlands increases wolf movement and consequently predation on woodland caribou in northern Alberta.</p> </div>","","","Canada; species-at-risk; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; bog; caribou; caribou, boreal population; predation; timber wolf; fen; fauna; mammals; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recovery of black spruce (Picea mariana (P. Mill.) B.S.P.) and tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch) on these disturbed peatlands is thought to depend on the recovery of hummock topography. In late winter, numerous large blocks of frozen peat (1.5 x 1.5 m) were lifted out of the flattened drilling pads and positioned beside their excavated hollows; this was done on six temporary pads. Four years later, the condition of the mounds and the regeneration of conifers from natural seed dispersal were assessed on these elevated mounds compared to adjacent flattened areas of the pads. Then, conifer seedling density was more than five times higher on elevated spots than the mostly flat, flood-prone areas between them, and seedling density was positively related to mound height and strength of seed source. Higher mounds tended to have larger seedlings. Mounds on some of the pads were heavily eroded down; these pads had peat with higher humification, and operationally these pads were also treated in late winter when peat was thawing and fractured into pieces during mound construction. Developing a large volume of elevated substrate that persists until natural hummock-forming mosses can establish is thought necessary for tree recruitment and the recovery of the habitat for the threatened woodland caribou of this region.","2017-07-15","2025-01-23 19:24:35","2025-03-08 14:23:31","","258-264","","","197","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000401880100026","8.7","1","SC: 0000034","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines whether the restoration of hummocky microtopography can restore vegetation in moderately rich fens impacted by well pads and roads or other linear disturbances.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; on-site restoration; vegetation; mine footprint; mining; vascular plants; substrate disturbance; fen; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; woody plants; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With slow to minimal recovery of tree cover along these corridors, seismic lines have become a persistent landscape feature affecting connectivity and habitat quality in forested ecosystems, particularly in wetland areas. Soil mounding is a common ground preparation treatment widely applied along seismic lines, with the expectation that it will enhance tree seedling establishment and improve the return of tree cover to disturbed areas. However, much is still unknown about environmental responses following treatment application. In this study, we compared the ground microtopography in treated and untreated seismic lines, as well as the relative elevation between treated and untreated seismic lines with their adjacent treed peatland. The ground elevation in both treated and untreated sites was significantly lower on seismic lines relative to their adjacent treed peatland, with a greater elevation difference in treated areas. Likewise, ground microtopography was orders of magnitude higher along treated areas compared to the natural variation in the adjacent treed peatland. Given the important changes in relative elevation and topography following treatment application, our results suggest the potential for eventual treatment success may be more unpredictable than expected; this may have critical consequences for other ecological properties beyond the restoration goal of tree establishment and return of tree cover.","2023-11","2025-01-23 19:24:35","2025-03-12 01:48:47","","","","8","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000904007800001","3.2","2","SC: 0000009","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of soil mounding on the restoration of vegetation on seismic lines in the boreal forest.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; linear disturbance; on-site restoration; seismic lines; vegetation; vascular plants; microtopography; mitigation hierarchy; substrate rehabilitation; woody plants; physiography; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multi-year home ranges (100% minimum convex polygon; MCP) averaged 711 km(2), with the size of individual home ranges (HR) correlated with the area of fen complexes. Summer HRs were smaller than winter HRs, and smaller for females than males in summer, but not winter. Locations were further from fen/upland boundaries winter than in summer, and further from fen/upland boundaries than random points within fens in both seasons. Movement rates were highest in winter and lowest in summer, and did not differ between sexes. There was a negative correlation between movement rate and snow depth at month-end. Monthly trends in group size paralleled those in movement rates, while group composition was relatively stable throughout most of the year. Trends in group size, movement, and spatial distribution suggest caribou increased spacing among themselves during summer, and were more concentrated during winter.

We used CTs (n = 73) from 2016 to 2019 to assess impacts of habitat change in a boreal landscape of northern Canada, where seismic lines for petroleum exploration disturbed wildlife habitat and prompted vegetation restoration efforts. First, we quantified vegetation dynamics from CTs, comparing them to satellite-based estimates that are typically used to monitor vegetation at broad spatial scales. We then used understory phenology and productivity estimated from CT time-lapse images to assess vegetation recovery on seismic lines. Finally, we related vegetation dynamics with the habitat use of three wildlife species: sandhill cranes Grus canadensis, woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus, and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus. CTs provided unique insight into vegetation dynamics that were different from signals measured by satellites, with temporally inconsistent and even some negative correlations between CT and satellite metrics. We found some indication of vegetation recovery on seismic lines that had received restoration treatment, with understory patterns more similar to undisturbed habitat than to seismic lines that did not receive restoration treatment. CTs also provided inferences about wildlife activity related to vegetation resources, which approaches using satellite data failed to detect. Wildlife habitat use tracked vegetation phenology, but did not always increase with vegetation productivity at weekly, 16-day, or annual intervals.

The effects of landscape disturbance generally vary among species and depend on the nature of the disturbances, which may interact and result in synergistic effects. Western Canada's oil sands region experiences disturbances from forestry and energy sector activities as well as municipal and transportation infrastructure. The effects of those disturbances on single species have been studied and have been implicated in declines of the boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Yet, the specific responses of the mammal community, and of functional groups such as prey and predators, to those interacting disturbances are still poorly known. We investigated the responses of black bear, grey wolf, coyote, fisher, lynx, red fox, American red squirrel, white-tailed deer, moose, caribou, and snowshoe hare to both natural habitat and disturbance associated with anthropogenic features within Alberta's northeast boreal forest. We used a novel community-level modelling framework on three years of camera-trap data collected in an oil sands landscape. This framework allowed us to identify the natural and anthropogenic features which explained the most variation in occurrence frequency among functional groups, as well as compare responses to linear and non-linear anthropogenic disturbance. Occurrence frequency by predators was better explained by anthropogenic features than by natural habitat. Both linear and non-linear anthropogenic features helped explain occurrence frequency by prey and predators, although the effects differed in magnitude and spatial scale. To better conserve boreal biodiversity, management actions should extend beyond a focus on caribou and wolves and aim to restore habitat across a diversity of anthropogenic disturbances and monitor the dynamics of the entire mammal community.

Their populations are believed to be limited by loss or degradation of wetland habitat due to drainage, altered hydrology, and fire suppression, factors that have often resulted in encroachment of shrubs into sedge meadows and change in vegetative cover. Nocturnal call-playback surveys for Yellow Rails were conducted over 3 years at Seney National Wildlife Refuge in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Effects of habitat structure and landscape variables on the probability of use by Yellow Rails were assessed at two scales, representing a range of home range sizes, using generalized linear mixed models. At the 163-m (8-ha) scale, year with quadratic models of maximum and mean water depths best explained the data. At the 300-m (28-ha) scale, the best model contained year and time since last fire (<= 1, 2-5, and > 10 years). The probability of use by Yellow Rails was 0.285 +/- 0.132 (SE) for points burned 2-5 years ago, 0.253 +/- 0.097 for points burned <= 1 year ago, and 0.028 +/- 0.019 for points burned > 10 years ago. Habitat differences relative to fire history and comparisons between sites with and without Yellow Rails indicated that Yellow Rails used areas with the deepest litter and highest ground cover, and relatively low shrub cover and heights, as well as landscapes having greater sedge-grass cover and less lowland woody or upland cover types. Burning every 2-5 years appears to provide the litter, ground-level cover, and woody conditions attractive to Yellow Rails. Managers seeking to restore and sustain these wetland systems would benefit from further investigations into how flooding and fire create habitat conditions attractive to breeding Yellow Rails.","2013-06","2025-01-23 19:40:00","2025-03-07 18:21:41","","199-213","","2","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000320345000008","0.3","4","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of fire on habitat variables for yellow rail in Michigan.

Such exposure can occur in the tailings ponds of the mineable oil sands, which are located in Alberta, Canada, under a major continental flyway for waterfowl. Over the 40 year history of the industry, a few thousand bird deaths have been reported following contact with bitumen on the ponds, but a new monitoring programme demonstrated that many thousands of birds land annually without apparent harm. This new insight creates an urgent need for more information on the sublethal effects on birds from non-bitumen toxicants that occur in the water, including naphthenic acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals and salts. Ten studies have addressed the effects of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW), and none reported acute or substantial adverse health effects. Interpretive caution is warranted, however, because nine of the studies addressed reclaimed wetlands that received OSPW, not OSPW ponds per se, and differences between experimental and reference sites may have been reduced by shared sources of pollution in the surrounding air and water. Two studies examined eggs of birds nesting >100 km from the mine sites. Only one study exposed birds directly and repeatedly to OSPW and found no consistent differences between treated and control birds in blood-based health metrics. If it is true that aged forms of OSPW do not markedly affect the health of birds that land briefly on the ponds, then the extensiveness of current bird-deterrent programmes is unwarranted and could exert negative net environmental effects. More directed research on bird health is urgently needed, partly because birds that land on these ponds subsequently migrate to destinations throughout North America where they are consumed by both humans and wildlife predators.","2015-10-03","2025-01-23 22:29:03","2025-02-10 13:45:20","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000375200100001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the sub-lethal effects on migratory waterfowl of contamination by hydrocarbons and heavy metals in oil sands tailings ponds.

The utility of this method is demonstrated by investigating the link between water management in South Florida and nesting failure by wood storks in the Everglades wetland. With the quantitative measures of hydroperiod derived by harmonic analysis, I am able to demonstrate statistically the relationships between water management and hydroperiod in the Everglades and between hydroperiod and the probability of nesting failure.

Fungi are intimately tied to peatland C budgets due to their roles in organic matter decomposition and symbioses with primary producers; however, the influence of fertilization on peatland fungal composition and diversity remains unclear. Here, we examined the effect of fertilization over 10 years on fungal diversity, composition, and functional guilds along an acrotelm (10-20 cm), mesotelm (30-40 cm), and catotelm (60-70 cm) depth gradient at the Mer Bleue bog, Canada. Simultaneous N and PK additions decreased the relative abundance of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and increased ectomycorrhizal fungi and lignocellulose-degrading fungi. Fertilization effects were not more pronounced in the acrotelm relative to the catotelm, nor was there a shift toward nitrophilic taxa after N addition. The direct effect of fertilization significantly decreased the abundance of Sphagnum-associated fungi, primarily owing to the overarching role of limiting nutrients rather than a decline in Sphagnum cover. Increased nutrient loading may threaten peatland C stocks if lignocellulose-degrading fungi become abundant and accelerate decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter. Additionally, future changes in plant communities, strong water table fluctuations, and peat subsidence after long-term nutrient loading may also influence fungal functional guilds and depth-dependencies of fungal community structure.","2024-11","2025-01-24 20:31:48","2025-03-07 18:27:45","","","","11","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001368124300001","11.6","1","SC: 0000000","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the response of fungal communities and Sphagnum to long-term nitrogen fertilization in a bog.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; biogeochemistry; peatland; vegetation; microbial activity; nutrients; bryophytes; sphagnum; nutrient enrichment; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eutrophication is characterized by excessive plant and algal growth due to the increased availability of one or more growth ""limiting nutrients"", in freshwater generally considered to be controlled by the bioavailability of phosphorus (P). The Somerset Levels and Moors (SLMs) catchments are subject to intensive agriculture and wastewater inputs which leads to nutrient contamination of the inflow waters, to the extent that they fail Water Framework Directive Good Status targets for P concentrations. In 2021, Natural England downgraded the status of the SLMs Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) to 'Unfavourable Declining', owing to poor water quality, mostly associated with P concentrations and associated duckweed and filamentous algal blooms. Macroplant nutrient concentrations were analysed in ditches, dipwells, soil, sediment and harvested plant biomass across a number of sites to provide an assessment of the overall apportionment of P inputs and reservoirs. Here we present a combined dataset of stores, fluxes and loadings of P. The data show large temporal and spatial changes in the concentrations of P and nitrogen (N) across the peat rich soils. We suggest how an altered hydrological regime and plant biomass harvesting could be used to reduce further eutrophication and how legacy P stored in the peat body could be mobilized by flooding and over time evacuated from the wetland. The findings suggest how paludiculture (wet agricultural crops) and rewetting of the peat body may help to restore the Ramsar wetland. We discuss how complex biogeochemical interactions occur during the rewetting process and how the need to export P via new land management mitigation measures should be balanced against requirements to maximise regulating and provisioning ecosystem services.","2023-09-01","2025-01-24 20:31:48","2025-03-07 18:20:41","","","","","287","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001037026300001","6.7","1","SC: 0000003","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents alternatives for the management of excess phosphorus in peatlands.

Our survey design comprised upstream (directly below drainage network) and downstream (similar to 300 m downstream) with nutrient (TP, TN) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and inorganic sediment cover increasing with intensifying drainage, in both upstream and downstream sites. Species richness of both benthic macroinvertebrates and bryophytes was strongly reduced with increasing drainage intensity. Upstream and downstream sites responded in a similar manner, suggesting wide-ranging impacts of drainage on stream biodiversity. Regardless of site location, ecosystem processes were unrelated to drainage intensity. Our results confirm that intense peatland drainage not only modifies environmental conditions and biodiversity in adjoining streams, but these impacts propagate further downstream in the stream network. To prevent further degradation of drainage-impacted freshwater ecosystems, large-scale peatland restoration is needed, with prioritization of sites with the greatest potential (least drainage-induced damage) for biodiversity recovery.","2023-09-01","2025-01-24 20:31:48","2025-09-26 20:31:40","","","","","543","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001016779600001","3.7","1","SC: 0000008","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of large-scale drainage and finds large effects on on the downstream bryophyte and macro-invertebrate communities.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; vegetation; decomposition; nutrients; drawdown; carbon cycle; bryophytes; dissolved organic carbon; ditching; arthropods; watercourses; fauna; hydrological alteration; macroinvertebrates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, nitrogen loads may exceed a fen's natural nutrient removal capacity, leading to increased eutrophication of adjacent water bodies. Therefore, it is important to address possible means to decrease a fen's nutrient load, including nutrient uptake by fen plants. To assess how much fen plants can contribute to nutrient removal by uptake, nutrient stocks of above- and below-ground biomass need to be quantified. Therefore, we investigated nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium uptake capacities of sedges (Carex species), which are common dominants in fen plant communities. We grew specimens of five Carex species with varying preferences in nutrient availability under controlled, different nutrient levels. We show that Carex above-ground biomass harvest can remove up to one third of a system's total nitrogen even at high loads of about 40 g nitrogen m(-2). Species-specific differences in biomass production, rather than preferences in nutrient availability under natural conditions, were drivers of standing nutrient stocks: Highly productive species, i.e., C. acutiformis and C. rostrata, had highest nutrient standing stocks across all nutrient levels. Amounts of nutrients stored in shoots increased almost linearly with increasing nutrient levels, whereas below-ground nutrient stocks species-specifically increased, saturated, or decreased, with increasing nutrient levels. As a rough estimate, depending on the species, 6-16 cycles of an-nual above-ground harvest would suffice to decrease nitrogen concentrations from the highest to the lowest level used in this study. Overall, our results indicate that Carex biomass harvest can be an efficient means to coun-teract anthropogenic nitrogen eutrophication in fens. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies have shown that top-down controls through predator-prey dynamics can influence ecosystem function, yet this has not been evaluated in peatlands to date. Here, we used a combination of nutrient enrichment and trophic-level manipulation to test the hypothesis that interactions between nutrient availability (bottom-up) and predation (top-down) influence peatland carbon fluxes. Elevated nutrients stimulated bacterial biomass and organic matter decomposition. In the absence of top-down regulation, carbon dioxide (CO2) respiration driven by greater decomposition was offset by elevated algal productivity. Herbivores accelerated CO2 emissions by removing algal biomass, while predators indirectly reduced CO2 emissions by muting herbivory in a trophic cascade.

However, these results have mainly been derived from experiments in which N was applied as ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), neglecting the fact that in polluted areas, wet deposition may be dominated either by NO3- or NH4+. We studied effects of elevated wet deposition of NO3- vs. NH4+ alone (8 or 56 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) over and above the background of 8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for 5 to 11 years) or combined with phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) on Sphagnum quality for decomposers, mass loss, and associated changes in hummock pore water in an ombrotrophic bog (Whim). Adding N, especially as NH4+, increased N concentration in Sphagnum, but did not enhance mass loss from Sphagnum. Mass loss seemed to depend mainly on moss species and climatic factors. Only high applications of N affected hummock pore water chemistry, which varied considerably over time. Overall, C and N cycling in this N treated bog appeared to be decoupled. We conclude that moss species, seasonal and annual variation in climatic factors, direct negative effects of N (NH4+ toxicity) on Sphagnum production, and indirect effects (increase in pH and changes in plant species dominance under elevated NO3- alone and with PK) drive Sphagnum decomposition and hummock C and N dynamics at Whim.","2016-11-15","2025-01-24 20:31:48","2025-03-07 22:07:09","","314-322","","","571","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000383930400033","9.8","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of N enrichment on the decomposition of Sphagnum and finds that it does not have an effect. </p> </div>","","","peatland; vegetation; decomposition; carbon cycle; bryophytes; sphagnum; nutrient enrichment; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly important for biodiverse mesotrophic fens, sensitive to acidification and eutrophication. Mesocosm experiments were conducted to study the interactive effects of water level fluctuation and P-enrichment under controlled summer conditions, using peat cores including vegetation from three fens differing in biogeochemical characteristics. The effects of fluctuating water levels on biogeochemistry and vegetation appeared to be highly dependent on peat chemistry, and more important than the effects of P-enrichment. Only when plant growth was stimulated by a favorable water level regime, P-enrichment led to increased P-consumption by plants. In rich fens with a high soil Ca-content, 7 weeks of lowered water table (-15 cm) did not lead to a drop in pH. However, soil subsidence, increased N-availability and decline of the rich fen bryophyte Scorpidium scorpioides give cause to concern. 7 weeks of inundation (+15 cm) offered possibilities for restoration in these fens, since alkalinity and Ca-concentrations increased, while soil P-mobilization did not occur. Even P-enrichment did not result in increased P-availability, presumably due to Ca-related precipitation of P. In rich fens with a high soil Fe-content, water table lowering should be avoided as well, because of soil subsidence, increased N-availability, decline of the rich fen bryophyte Calliergon giganteum, plus acidification due to Fe-oxidation. Shallow inundation, however, is also harmful, especially after mowing and with P-rich water, because plant growth was hampered, presumably by toxicity of NH4+ and/or Fe(II). In mineral-poor fens with a high soil P- and S-content, shallow inundation should be avoided, because of tremendous internal P-mobilization. Vitality of the dominant bryophyte Sphagnum palustre, however, was not affected. Low water tables affected neither vegetation, nor biogeochemistry, showing resistance to short-term drought in these fens. Given the strong mediating effect of soil chemistry, risks and benefits of re-establishment of fluctuating water levels with clean or P-rich water need to be considered for different fen types separately in water and nature management.","2015-12","2025-01-24 20:31:48","2025-03-12 01:56:52","","226-236","","","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000365322700023","3.8","2","SC: 0000018","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of water table fluctuation and P enrichment on the biogeochemistry of a mesotrophic fen. </p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; cumulative effects; hydrology; peatland; nutrients; water table; rewetting; nutrient enrichment; fen; hydrological management; fertility change/contamination; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gross photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration, and net CO2 exchange were measured weekly during May-September 2011 using climate-controlled chambers. A substrate-induced respiration technique was used to determine the functional ability of the microbial community. The highest N and NPK additions were associated with 40% less net CO2 uptake than the control. In the NPK additions, a diminished C sink potential was due to a 20-30% increase in ecosystem respiration, while gross photosynthesis rates did not change as greater vascular plant biomass compensated for the decrease in Sphagnum mosses. In the highest N-only treatment, small reductions in gross photosynthesis and no change in ecosystem respiration led to the reduced C sink. Substrate-induced microbial respiration was significantly higher in all levels of NPK additions compared with control. The temperature sensitivity of respiration in the plots was lower with increasing cumulative N load, suggesting more labile sources of respired CO2. The weaker C sink potential could be explained by changes in nutrient availability, higher woody:foliar ratio, moss loss, and enhanced decomposition. Stronger responses to NPK fertilization than to N-only fertilization for both shrub biomass production and decomposition suggest that the bog ecosystem is N-P/K colimited rather than N-limited. Negative effects of further N-only deposition were indicated by delayed spring CO2 uptake. In contrast to forests, increased wood formation and surface litter accumulation in bogs seem to reduce the C sink potential owing to the loss of peat-forming Sphagnum.","2013-12","2025-01-24 20:31:48","2025-03-07 22:06:57","","3729-3739","","12","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000326836000015","11.6","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of long-term nutrient enrichment on the greenhouse gas and carbon sequestration dynamics in a peatland in eastern Ontario.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; biogeochemistry; peatland; bog; greenhouse gases; nutrients; carbon sequestration; pollution; carbon cycle; air pollution; nutrient enrichment; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their combined effects may differ strongly from their separate effects, since each process affects different nutrients through different mechanisms. However, the impacts of these environmental problems are rarely studied in combination. We therefore investigated the separate and interactive effects of current levels of N- and S-deposition and changes in soil moisture dynamics on fen meadow vegetation. We focused on vegetation biomass and N:P stoichiometry, including access to soil P through root surface phosphatase activity, in a 3-year factorial addition experiment in an N-limited rich fen meadow in the Biebrza valley in Poland. We applied 29.5 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and 32.1 kg S ha(-1) year(-1), which correspond to current deposition levels in Western Europe. Changes in soil moisture dynamics due to climate change were mimicked by amplified drying of the soil in summer. This level of N-deposition had limited effects on plant biomass production in this rich fen, despite low foliar N:P ratios that suggest N limitation. This level of S-deposition, however, resulted in decreased vegetation P-uptake and biomass. We also showed that increased summer drought resulted in considerable increases in vegetation biomass. We found no interactive effects on vegetation biomass or N:P stoichiometry, possibly as a result of the limited main effects of the separate processes.","2012-11","2025-01-24 20:31:48","2025-03-07 18:27:34","","139-150","","1-3","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000314063200009","4","2","SC: 0000015","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the combination of N and S enrichment and water table drawdown on the vegetation of a fen in Europe and found that S enrichment and water table drawdown had the greatest effects. </p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; climate change; cumulative effects; peatland; vegetation; nutrients; drawdown; carbon cycle; primary productivity; fen; sulphur compounds; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measured maximum photosynthetic rate (NPmax), maximum efficiency of photosystem II [variable fluorescence (F (v))/maximum fluorescence yield (F (m))] and concentrations of N, C, chlorophyll and carotenoids as responses to N and S addition and increased temperature in Sphagnum balticum (a widespread species in the northern peatlands) in a 12-year factorial experiment. NPmax did not differ between control (0.2 g N m(-2) year(-1)) and high N (3.0 g N m(-2) year(-1)), but was higher in the mid N treatment (1.5 g N m(-2) year(-1)). N, C, carotenoids and chlorophyll concentration increased in shoot apices after N addition. F (v)/F (m) did not differ between N treatments. Increased temperature (+3.6A degrees C) had a small negative effect on N concentration, but had no significant effect on NPmax or F (v)/F (m). Addition of 2 g S m(-2) year(-1) showed a weak negative effect on NPmax and F (v)/F (m). Our results suggest a unimodal response of NPmax to N addition and tissue N concentration in S. balticum, with an optimum N concentration for photosynthetic rate of similar to 13 mg N g(-1). In conclusion, high S deposition may reduce photosynthetic capacity in Sphagnum, but the negative effects may be relaxed under high N availability. We suggest that previously reported negative effects on Sphagnum productivity under high N deposition are not related to negative effects on the photosynthetic apparatus, but differences in optimum N concentration among Sphagnum species may affect their competitive ability under different N deposition regimes.","2009-09","2025-01-24 20:31:48","2025-03-07 22:07:08","","481-490","","3","161","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000269010300004","2.7","2","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of simultaneous N and S enrichment and soil warming on the primary productivity of sphagnum. </p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; cumulative effects; vegetation; soil temperature; soil warming; nutrients; substrate disturbance; pollution; carbon cycle; primary productivity; air pollution; bryophytes; sphagnum; nutrient enrichment; sulphur compounds; climate; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the factors favoring that peat accumulation, a major role is played by the chemical quality of plant litter itself, which is poor in nutrients and characterized by polyphenols with a strong inhibitory effect on microbial breakdown. Because bogs receive their nutrient supply solely from atmospheric deposition, the global increase of atmospheric nitrogen (N) inputs as a consequence of human activities could potentially alter the litter chemistry with important, but still unknown, effects on their C balance. Here we present data showing the decomposition rates of recently formed litter peat samples collected in nine European countries under a natural gradient of atmospheric N deposition from approximate to 0.2 to 2 g center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1). We found that enhanced decomposition rates for material accumulated under higher atmospheric N supplies resulted in higher carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and dissolved organic carbon release. The increased IN availability favored microbial decomposition (i) by removing N constraints on microbial metabolism and (ii) through a chemical amelioration of litter peat quality with a positive feedback on microbial enzymatic activity. Although some uncertainty remains about whether decay-resistant Sphagnum will continue to dominate litter peat, our data indicate that, even without such changes, increased N deposition poses a serious risk to our valuable peatland C sinks.","2006-12-19","2025-01-24 20:31:49","2025-03-07 22:07:10","","19386-19389","","51","103","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000243166600031","11.1","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the impact of increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition on the release of greenhouse gases and DOC from bogs in Europe.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; bog; greenhouse gases; nutrients; pollution; carbon cycle; air pollution; nutrient enrichment; dissolved organic carbon; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of increased nitrogen or phosphorus supply on the productivity of Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic bogs in northern and southern Sweden were studied. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition in southern Sweden (high-N site) exceeds that in northern Sweden (low-N site) by about tenfold. 2. Vertical height growth of the Sphagnum carpet was measured by the cranked-wire method. Length growth of individuals was measured by autoradiography after labelling with (CO2)-C-14. The results of both methods were significantly correlated, but the cranked-wire data were systematically lower. 3. Productivity of Sphagnum at the low-N site increased almost fourfold after additional nitrogen supply (4 g N m-2 year-1), but no increase was found after additional phosphorus supply (0.4 g P m-2 year-1). At the high-N site, phosphorus supply caused an almost threefold productivity increase, but nitrogen supply did not result in any productivity increase. Thus, in an area with a high atmospheric nitrogen supply, plant productivity is P-limited instead of N-limited. 4. At an intermediate nitrogen supply (2 g N m-2 year-1) the recovery of the supplied nitrogen in the Sphagnum carpet was not different for both sites (60% and 69%, respectively). However, at a high nitrogen supply (4 g N m-2 year-1) nitrogen recovery at the low-N site significantly exceeded that at the high-N site (73% and 47%, respectively). At the low-N site, the supplied phosphorus was not recovered, but at the high-N site the phosphorus recovery was 85% (intermediate phosphorus supply) and 100% (high phosphorus supply), respectively. 5. It is suggested that a high atmospheric nitrogen supply may affect the carbon balance of ombrotrophic bogs, because productivity is under these circumstances not N-limited, but decomposition is probably increased by high loads of nitrogen. In the end, this may turn these C-accumulating systems into C-emitting systems.","1992","2025-01-24 20:31:49","2025-03-07 22:07:09","","131-140","","1","80","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1992HY00900013","5.5","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the growth limiting nutrients of sphagnum in peatlands in areas of high versus low high atmospheric nitrogen deposition.

Sphagnum capillifolium mats, transplanted from an unpolluted site to the polluted southern Pennines in England [UK], also initially retained a large proportion of deposited nitrate and ammonium.  However, a laboratory experiment demonstrated that high rates of nitrogen supply cause a loss of the ability of the moss to retain nitrate, which suggests that this may occur as a result of increased nitrogen deposition in polluted regions, resulting in increased nitrate availability in the peat. Investigation of the volume of precipitation and amounts of sulphate and chloride passing through the Sphagnum mats in the southern Pennines, as compared to that collected in adjacent bulk deposition  gauges, showed that conventional deposition monitoring grossly underestimates rates of deposition to vegetation. Efficient trapping of occult and dry deposition by the moss led to much greater volumes of precipitation and amounts of sulphate and chloride being measured in throughflow than in bulk precipitation samples. Physiological response of S. fuscum to occult precipitation and heavy rainfall was investigated by measuring nitrate reductase activity induced in the moss by nitrate supplied  in ''fine mist'' and ''large droplet'' applications of solutions to moss in the field. Greater response was shown to occult deposition, suggesting that this form of precipitation may be important in vegetation damage in polluted regions.","1987","2025-01-24 20:31:49","2025-03-12 01:56:53","","61-72","","1","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1987H213000005","8.9","2","SC: 0000080","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of nitrogen enrichment from acidic deposition on the growth and nutrient retention of sphagnum. </p> <p></p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; vegetation; nutrients; pollution; air pollution; bryophytes; sphagnum; nutrient enrichment; sulphur compounds; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peatland bird populations have shown a substantial decline during the recent decades in Northern Europe as a consequence of peatland drainage. We studied whether restoration of peatlands drained for forestry affects bird communities. We conducted bird surveys at 11 peatlands in Western Finland, where each of the restored and their pristine counterparts were surveyed before restoration and yearly after restoration during 2010-2018. We used linear mixed effect models to analyze whether restoration affected the number of species and territories of peatland specialist and non-specialist species and permutational multivariate analysis of variance to analyze the change in community composition. Drained parts of the peatlands had higher number of territories of non-specialist species before restoration, and restoration seemed to decrease these numbers towards the level of pristine parts. By contrast, restoration did not affect the number of peatland specialists and their territories, which was lower in drained than in pristine parts of the peatlands. Bird communities in restored parts remained different from pristine parts in terms of community composition after restoration. Thus, despite the effect of restoration on non-specialists, a substantially long time may be required for a recovery of the peatland bird communities. Based on our results, it seems that long-term monitoring of the restored and pristine peatlands is needed to determine whether restoration is effective in recovering the peatland specialist bird species and bird communities in general.","2021-01","2025-01-24 21:22:12","2025-03-11 18:35:30","","","","1","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000592620000001","3.2","2","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of peatland restoration after forest harvest on the use by breeding birds and finds persistent differences in peatland bird communities as compared to natural peatlands. . </p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; drawdown; rewetting; forest harvest; migratory birds; mitigation hierarchy; fauna; birds; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As one of the EU Habitat Directive priority habitats, aapa mires are important for biodiversity and carbon cycling, harbouring several red-listed species and supporting unique species communities. Due to their sensitivity to hydrological disturbances, reliable, up-to-date and systematic information on the hydrological condition and responses of mires is crucial and required for multiple purposes ranging from carbon exchange modelling to EU Habitats Directive reporting and conservation and ecosystem restoration planning. Here, we demonstrate the usability of Sentinel-2 satellite data in a semi-automatic cloud-based approach to retrieve large-scale information on aapa mire hydrological variability. Two satellite-derived metrics, soil moisture index and the extent of water-saturated surfaces based on pixel-wise classification, are used to quantify monthly and interannual wetness variation between 2017 and 2020 across Natura 2000 aapa mires in Finland, including responses to the extreme drought of 2018. The results revealed high temporal variability in wetness, particularly in the southern parts of the aapa mire zone and generally in the late summer months interannually. Observations from the drought summer showed that one third of usually year-round wet flark surfaces may be exposed to drying during climatic extremes. Responses varied between sites and regions, implicating the significance of environmental factors for drought resistance: some sites maintained high levels of moisture, whereas others lost wet surfaces completely. Our study provides the first comprehensive national-level representation of seasonal and interannual wetness variability and drought-sensitivity of pristine aapa mire sites. The approach and methods used here can be directly upscaled outside protected areas and to other EU countries. Thus, they provide a means for harmonized, systematic large-scale monitoring of this priority habitat, as well as valuable information for other applications supporting peatland conservation and research.","2024-04","2025-01-24 21:27:33","2025-03-12 01:25:04","","172-187","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001050099600001","5.5","2","SC: 0000009","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper uses satellite remote sensing to assess the hydrology in string fens in Europe. </p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; water table; remote sensing; satellite imagery; monitoring; string fen / aapa mire; pools/ponds; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They play an important role as carbon sinks in their natural state, but when they are drained, they cause carbon emissions. Rewetting drained peatlands is required to reduce carbon emissions and create new carbon sinks. However, drained peatlands are commonly used as grassland or croplands; therefore, alternative agriculture schemes are required following rewetting. Paludiculture, i.e., agriculture on wet and rewetted peatlands, is an option in these areas after rewetting to produce biomass sustainably. Monitoring of peatland management is challenging, yet needed to ensure a successful rewetting and plantation of, e.g., Phragmites australis and Typha spp., two plants which are commonly used in paludiculture. Remote sensing is an excellent tool for monitoring the vegetation composition of vast rewetted peatland regions. However, because many peatland species have similar spectral characteristics, such monitoring is ideally based on high-spatial, high-temporal hyperspectral images. Data that complies with all these requirements does not exist on a regular basis. Therefore, we assessed the potential for mapping peatland vegetation communities in the Peene and Trebel river basins of the federal state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, using multi-date hyperspectral (PRISMA) data. We used regression-based unmixing to map fractions of different peatland vegetation classes. Results were analyzed with regard to the contribution of multi-date observations and, in comparison, to multispectral datasets (Landsat-8/Sentinel-2). Our results showed that different classes are best mapped at different observation dates. The multi-date hyperspectral datasets produced less Mean Absolute Error (MAE =16.4%) than the single-date hyperspectral images (& UDelta;MAE + 1%), with high accuracies for all classes of interest. Compared to the results obtained with multispectral data from similar acquisition dates and annual spectral-temporal metrics (STM), the results from hyperspectral data were always clearly superior (& UDelta;MAE + 4%). Besides the superior performance during comparisons, our results also indicate that information that can be derived from the hyperspectral data with the regression-based unmixing goes clearly beyond that of discrete classification. With more hyperspectral sensors coming up and an expected higher availability of multidata hyperspectral imagery, these data can be expected to play a bigger role in the future monitoring of peatlands.","2023-10","2025-01-24 21:27:33","2025-03-12 17:51:27","","","","","154","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001048841600001","6.9","2","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper uses satellite multidate hyperspectral imaging to monitor vegetation in peatlands used for agriculture.</p> </div>","","","peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; remote sensing; satellite imagery; monitoring; agriculture; vegetation disturbance; graminoids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In general, velocities are measured based on the assumption that future climatically similar locations can occur anywhere in the study landscape. However, this assumption can provide a biased basis for habitats which are constrained to specific environmental conditions. For such habitats, a set of selected suitable locations may provide ecologically more realistic velocity measures. Here, we focus on one environmentally constrained habitat, aapa mires, which are peat-accumulating EU Habitats Directive pri-ority habitats, whose ecological conditions and biodiversity values may be jeopardised by climate change. We assess the climate exposure of aapa mires in Finland by developing velocity metrics separately for the whole >= 10 ha aapa mire complexes ('aapa mires') and their wettest flark-dominated parts ('flark fens'). Velocity metrics were developed for six bioclimatic variables (growing degree days (GDD5), mean January and July temperatures, annual precipitation, and May and July water balance, based on climate data for 1981-2010 and for 2040-2069 as derived from global climate models for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). For the six variables, velocities were calculated based on the distance between climatically similar present-day and nearest future mire, divided by the number of years between the two periods, and by excluding the unsuitable matrix. Both aapa mires and flark fens showed high exposure (>5 km/year) to changes in January temperature, and often also considerably high velocities for GDD5 and July temperatures. The flark fens showed significantly higher climate velocities than the aapa mires and had a smaller amount of corresponding habitat in their surroundings. Thus, many of the studied mires, particularly the flark fens, are likely to face increased risks of exposure due to changes in winter and summer temperatures. Moreover, considerable changes in precipitation -related conditions may occur at the southern margin of the aapa mire zone. Our results show that specifically tailored climate velocity metrics can provide a useful quantitative tool to inform conservation and management decisions to support the ecosystem sustainability of this EU Habitats Directive biotope and targeting restoration towards the most vulnerable aapa mires.","2022-12","2025-01-24 21:27:33","2025-03-11 18:36:02","","","","","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000879222900002","5.1","3","SC: 0000004","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the microclimatic effects of climate change on string fens (aapa mires).</p> </div>","","","climate change; peatland; fen; migratory birds; fauna; birds; string fen / aapa mire; pools/ponds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dragonflies are valuable ecological indicators, but comprehensive studies on the species inhabiting peatlands are limited. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the determinants of peatland odonate assemblages in the Italian Alps along the bog-poor fen-rich fen series, a vegetation gradient influenced by pH. The ultimate goal was to distil management recommendations to inform peatland dragonfly conservation. Species richness, bog specialist richness, and community composition were assessed at both pristine and human-impacted sites and then related to environmental and antrophogenic drivers. We showed that bog and poor fen assemblages were significantly distinct from those of intermediate and rich fens, which, in turn, displayed the highest species richness, but the lowest number of specialists, whilst being also the most degraded. Excavated sites, compared to non-excavated ones, harboured a higher number of species, although this effect was not significant for bog specialists. Drainage and abandonment of mowing/grazing practices determined reed and shrub/tree invasion, negatively impacting fen species. Water availability and heterogeneous spatial arrangements of water pools within the peatland positively affected most species, with bog specialists only favoured by the latter. Peatland dragonfly conservation should primarily rely on the preservation of pristine sites, as they harbour unique dragonfly assemblages. Impacted sites could benefit from restoration actions; specifically, reed control, and the creation of pools of different sizes and depths within the more terrestrified peatlands are likely the most effective measures to support peatland Odonata communities.","2022-02","2025-01-24 21:27:33","2025-03-07 18:20:52","","703-722","","2","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000740394800001","3.4","2","SC: 0000010","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the controls for dragonfly communities in natural peatlands and restored peatlands following their use for agriculture.</p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; drawdown; rewetting; mitigation hierarchy; agriculture; arthropods; fauna; vegetation disturbance; hydrological management; pools/ponds; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet their use is contentious, and numerous problems with both the concept and the practice have been identified in the literature. Our starting point is the understanding that offsets are a kind of biodiversity compensation measure through which the goal of no net loss (or net gain) of biodiversity can be at least theoretically achieved. Based on a typology of compensation measures distinguishing between habitat protection, improvement (including restoration, habitat creation and improved management practices) and other compensation, we review the literature to develop a framework of conditions that must be met if habitat protection and improvement initiatives can be truly considered offsets and not merely a lesser form of compensation. It is important that such conceptual clarity is reflected in offset policy and guidance, if offsets are to be appropriately applied and to have any chance of fully compensating for biodiversity loss. Our framework can be used to support the review and ongoing development of biodiversity offset policy and guidance, with the aim of improving clarity, rigour and therefore the chances that good biodiversity outcomes can be achieved.","2021-02","2025-02-04 14:14:41","2025-03-07 22:07:57","","424-435","","2","67","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000609955700001","3.5","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the necessary conditions for successful biodiversity offsetting, including wetland offsetting. </p> </div>","","","offsetting; wetland policy; mitigation hierarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reliance on overly simplistic metrics in assessing the impacts of development, and assigning offset requirements, generally results in offsets which fail to conserve the key ecological values they seek to protect. We conducted a cross-disciplinary quantitative review, based on 255 peer-reviewed publications from three fields of research; offsetting (n = 43), conservation planning (n = 54) and ecology (n = 158), to explore which metrics are commonly used in offsetting compared to the conservation and ecology literature. We recorded the use of biodiversity metrics from 24 categories which captured broad habitat patterns (e.g. habitat area and condition) as well as specific biological and ecological mechanisms (e.g. diversity, population density or landscape connectivity). Our review found that offset studies and programs rely heavily on habitat attributes and area-based metrics, with > 70% of the offset literature having used these metrics. Habitat attributes and area-based metrics were less frequently reported in the conservation planning (56 and 59%, respectively) and ecological literature (49 and 15%). Ecological research had a higher frequency of metrics reflecting the biological and ecological processes relevant to biodiversity, such as species' population densities and species-specific connectivity. Our results also indicate a notable disconnect in how biodiversity is measured when offsets are planned compared to when their outcomes are evaluated. This demonstrates the need to re-evaluate the way offset policies and programs value, describe and measure biodiversity, so that critical biodiversity values and important ecological processes are appropriately captured, and no net loss is achieved.","2020-01","2025-02-04 14:14:41","2025-03-07 22:07:57","","","","","241","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000518695100040","5.9","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the monitoring approaches and metrics to measure the success of biodiversity offsetting, including wetland offsetting.</p> </div>","","","monitoring; offsetting; mitigation hierarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of no net loss is intended to help relieve tension between conservation and development by enabling economic gains to be achieved without concomitant biodiversity losses. biodiversity offsets represent a necessary component of a much broader mitigation strategy for achieving no net loss following prior application of avoidance, minimization, and remediation measures. However, doubts have been raised about the appropriate use of biodiversity offsets. We examined what no net loss means as a desirable conservation outcome and reviewed the conditions that determine whether, and under what circumstances, biodiversity offsets can help achieve such a goal. We propose a conceptual framework to substitute the often ad hoc approaches evident in many biodiversity offset initiatives. The relevance of biodiversity offsets to no net loss rests on 2 fundamental premises. First, offsets are rarely adequate for achieving no net loss of biodiversity alone. Second, some development effects may be too difficult or risky, or even impossible, to offset. To help to deliver no net loss through biodiversity offsets, biodiversity gains must be comparable to losses, be in addition to conservation gains that may have occurred in absence of the offset, and be lasting and protected from risk of failure. Adherence to these conditions requires consideration of the wider landscape context of development and offset activities, timing of offset delivery, measurement of biodiversity, accounting procedures and rule sets used to calculate biodiversity losses and gains and guide offset design, and approaches to managing risk. Adoption of this framework will strengthen the potential for offsets to provide an ecologically defensible mechanism that can help reconcile conservation and development.","2013-12","2025-02-04 14:14:41","2025-03-07 22:08:27","","1254-1264","","6","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000327564300014","6.3","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews biodiversity offsetting globally , including wetland offsetting, and presents conditions for successful offsetting, although these conditions are not easily achieved.</p> </div>","","","peatland; other wetland; offsetting; policy discussion paper; mitigation hierarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Trin. ex Steud.-common reed, is a perennial, emergent aquatic plant with annual cane-like stems developed from an extensive rhizome system. It grows in low-lying wet areas such as fresh and salt-water marshes, drainage ditches, shallow lake edges, sandy banks, roadsides, woodlands and rocky places. Stems can reach up to 6.0 m in height, vary in diameter from 4 to10 mm and have 10 to 25 cm long hollow internodes. Clones are extended by perennial rhizomes with extensive aerenchymatous tissue that supplies oxygen. Roots develop from rhizomes and other submerged parts of shoots. Leaves are smooth, alternate with narrow-lanceolate laminae, 20 to 70 cm long and 1 to 5 cm broad, and tapering to long slender points. The inflorescence is a terminal panicle, often 30 cm long, dull purple to yellow, with main branches bearing many spikelets. Seed production and germination are extremely variable and comparatively rare in many populations. Phragmites australis carries out photosynthesis through the C3 pathway (or a variation thereof). Studies of genetic variation through isozyme and other molecular methods suggest that the populations are very closely related, and that variation in the metapopulation is small. Chloroplast DNA sequences of two non-coding regions indicate that non-native introduced genotypes of P. australis have displaced native genotypes in parts of North America. Phragmites australis often forms extensive monocultures in North America. As a consequence, habitat quality and species diversity have been documented to decline. However, in roadside populations it is effective in taking up many typical heavy metals that originate from nearby highways and buildings. Phragmites australis is found in all Canadian provinces and the Northwest Territories, but not in the Yukon Territory or Nunavut. The infestation of P. australis is most severe in the Great Lakes region and its migration is primarily mediated through rivers, canals and waterways but roadways are increasingly becoming important. Changes in the water regime have been linked to its success and could ultimately result in changes to the floristic composition of a habitat. Rodeo?, an aqueous solution of the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate, is most frequently used to control P. australis populations. Other methods of control include cutting, burning, and drainage of the species? habitat. As P. australis is considered to be invasive in North America, introduction of biological control agents is now being investigated.

Drainage of the regional groundwater body has induced changes in the hydraulic properties of deep peat, with peat compression decreasing hydraulic conductivity and storativity while simultaneously introducing localized secondary porosity and effective storage. Where peat has increased in hydraulic conductivity, there is a corresponding decline in vertical hydraulic gradients and significant localized increases in recharge to the underlying substrate. Repeated topographic surveys show intense localized areas of peat consolidation (>5%) where it is underlain by highly permeable (>10 m/day) glacial till deposits. More widely, continued subsidence (4?6 mm/year) of the bog surface has been measured over 900 m from the bog margin, resulting in the progressive loss of approximately 40% of actively growing raised bog since 1991. This loss has thus been shown to be attributable to changes in the underlying groundwater head due to deep-cut drainage, rather than near-surface peatland drainage. However, although reinstating regional hydrostatic pressures in order to restore this ombrotrophic peatland may control the rapid drainage through preferential flow pathways, this may not eliminate the ecological impacts resulting from changed surface morphology arising from subsidence. Hence, this longitudinal study provides new insights into the role that aquifer systems and groundwater bodies play in maintaining hydrogeological processes in ombrotrophic peatland systems, while highlighting the difficulty in ecological restoration where regional groundwater dependencies are significant.","2019-07-01","2025-02-13 21:32:39","2025-03-12 01:48:51","2025-02-13","6153-6168","","7","55","","Water Resources Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.4","1","SC: 0000053  Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; bog; substrate disturbance; groundwater; drawdown; subsidence; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Water table levels dropped 3 cm after clear-cutting on the eighth site, which was the wettest site with precut water levels within the top 10 cm. This was explained by evaporation from exposed water surfaces. The magnitude of the water table rises increased with the depth of the precut water table. The seasonal mean and maximum rise were respectively 20 and 52 cm on a poorly drained mineral soil which had the lowest precut water table levels. The smallest rises, with means around 7 cm, were associated with high precut water table on bogs and on fens. The watering up was not reduced on fens where a lateral flow occurs. This study indicated that transition sites between the bogs or fens and the uplands were most susceptible to hydrologic changes after clear-cutting. Watering up was caused by reduced evapotranspiration, of which the major component was interception. The rise of the water table observed in the clear-cut and the bordering forest indicates that clear-cutting in narrow strips is not an effective solution to avoid water table rise. Silvicultural treatments to maintain interception and transpiration by leaving logging debris, small trees, and preestablished regeneration would be more effective.","1995-07-01","2025-02-14 17:42:42","2025-03-07 18:19:53","2025-02-14","1741-1750","","7","31","","Water Resources Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.4","1","SC: 0000204  Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that clear-cutting reduces evapotranspiration and raises the water table in peatlands.

The objective of this experimental study was to determine whether birch seedlings established on an abandoned mined peatland in eastern Canada had a significant impact on evapotranspiration. Transpiration rates from birch seedlings planted in containers filled with Sphagnum compost were measured gravimetrically. Unplanted containers were used to similarly measure evaporation rates from bare peat. On average, the measured rates of evaporation (per unit area) from peat were 2.5 times the rates of transpiration from birch leaves. However, if the total leaf area of a dense birch population established on an abandoned mined peatland is considered, the total amount of water lost through birch transpiration could be higher than that lost by evaporation from the peat surface. This study provides a rough estimate of potential water losses due to birch seedling transpiration, and indicates that a dense population of birch on a mined peatland may influence site hydrology even at the early establishment phase (seedlings). Consequently, recently abandoned mined peatlands should be restored rapidly to prevent the establishment of birch trees.","2009","2025-02-14 17:49:04","2025-03-12 01:56:53","","Article 03","","","5","","Mires and Peat","","","","","","","","English","","","CABI Databases","","1.2","4","SC: 0000047  Publisher: International Peat Society","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the impact of woody plants and their removal on the evapotranspiration and drawdown of the water table in peat extraction sites.</p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; water table; drawdown; evapotranspiration; woody plants; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we compare two monitoring methods, the line-point intercept (LPI) and the permanent plot (PP) methods, for evaluating plant recovery of a restored cut-over peatland (8.5 ha), following a “moss layer transfer technique”. We used the LPI method to estimate covers (from frequency measures) for each plant species using a systematic grid of approximately 5,700 points (every 3 m × 5 m). In parallel, 43 PP (3 m × 8 m) were established and used to evaluate plant covers. The post-restoration recovery of vegetation was assessed against a reference ecosystem encompassing the variation in species cover from natural undisturbed peatlands in the same region. For all plant groups considered, the LPI consistently showed higher cover estimates than the PP method. Discrepancy between the two methods was particularly evident for the Ericaceae group. A complementary sampling method, the line-intercept (LI), showed strong correlations with the visual estimations of Ericaceae covers (akin to PP), suggesting an overestimation from the LPI method. Most life form groups of the restored peatlands are developing a structure similar to the regional reference ecosystem 8 years post-restoration with the herb group being still most dissimilar. Indeed, when analyzing the temporal evolution of the different key peatland plant components, several are within the range of regional abundance values or moving positively towards range of cover abundance of the reference system such as Sphagnum cover, a key peat-accumulating plant group.","2013-02-01","2025-02-14 17:58:21","2025-03-12 01:56:43","","71-85","","1","21","","Wetlands Ecology and Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","1.8","4","SC: 0000079","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper compares methods to monitor the return of vegetation after peatland revegetation using the moss layer transfer technique.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; substrate disturbance; monitoring; active restoration; vegetation sampling; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; revegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effects of salinity and the spring?flush?fen gradients are of more local significance, usually easily recognized. Land use is an important additional factor. 3?The mineral-soil-water limit between ombrotrophic and minerotrophically influenced sites is not sharp, and cannot be related to consistent differences in either vegetation or water chemistry. It should be abandoned as a general main division within mires. 4?The most important natural division is between ?bog?, with pH generally ?6.0, high Ca2+ and HCO3?, vegetation rich in dicotyledonous herbs and ?brown mosses?. This division is reflected in a bimodal distribution of pH. 5?The terms oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic should refer only to nutrient richness (fertility, mainly N and P), not to base richness (metallic cations and pH). 6?It is recommended that ?mire? should embrace both wetlands on peat and related communities on mineral soils, that ?bog? (unqualified) should encompass both ombrotrophic and weakly minerotrophic mires, including ?bog woodland?, and that ?fen? should be restricted to base-rich mires but include both herbaceous and wooded vegetation (?fen carr?). 7?Definitions are given for a range of broadly defined categories that should cover most vegetation types commonly encountered. The relation of these to British national vegetation classification types and to major units in European phytosociology is outlined.","2000-04-01","2025-02-18 14:49:22","2025-03-07 22:06:54","2025-02-18","187-203","","2","88","","Journal of Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.5","1","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper summarizes the ecological gradients that exist in peatlands and their controls, especially the gradient between bogs and fens.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; vegetation; other wetland; bog; fen; swamp","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We synthesize understanding of sources, atmosphere-land-ocean Hg dynamics and health effects, and consider the implications of Hg-control policies. Primary anthropogenic Hg emissions greatly exceed natural geogenic sources, resulting in increases in Hg reservoirs and subsequent secondary Hg emissions that facilitate its global distribution. The ultimate fate of emitted Hg is primarily recalcitrant soil pools and deep ocean waters and sediments. Transfers of Hg emissions to largely unavailable reservoirs occur over the time scale of centuries, and are primarily mediated through atmospheric exchanges of wet/dry deposition and evasion from vegetation, soil organic matter and ocean surfaces. A key link between inorganic Hg inputs and exposure of humans and wildlife is the net production of methylmercury, which occurs mainly in reducing zones in freshwater, terrestrial, and coastal environments, and the subsurface ocean. Elevated human exposure to methylmercury primarily results from consumption of estuarine and marine fish. Developing fetuses are most at risk from this neurotoxin but health effects of highly exposed populations and wildlife are also a concern. Integration of Hg science with national and international policy efforts is needed to target efforts and evaluate efficacy.","2013-05-21","2025-02-18 17:31:25","2025-03-07 21:59:21","","4967-4983","","10","47","","Environ.

Can this moss facilitate the return of Sphagnum species or other boreal plants after disturbances? Field surveys of abandoned peatlands after peat extraction revealed that Sphagnum was always found in association with P. strictum carpets. We conducted field experiments in abandoned peatlands and showed that P. strictum carpets were able to keep Sphagnum fragments more humid than bare peat but only when the P. strictum carpets were not totally bone dry. In general, daytime temperatures beneath P. strictum carpets and fragments were reduced during the day and increased during the night compared to bare peat. Polytrichum strictum carpets acted as a seed trap, retaining more artificial seeds than bare peat. Polytrichum strictum can be a nurse-plant: after 16 months, vascular plants transplanted in the P. strictum carpet were healthier than the ones planted on bare peat. The use of P. strictum as a nurse-plant in boreal forest or peatland restoration is recommended for sites prone to frost heaving and with harsh microclimatic conditions.","2007-12-01","2025-02-18 19:48:00","2025-03-12 01:42:46","2025-02-18","709-719","","4","15","","Restoration Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.2","2","SC: 0000156  Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates how Polytrichum strictum acts as a nurse plant in peatland restoration by stabilizing the substrate.</p> </div>","","","Canada; on-site restoration; vegetation; substrate disturbance; bryophytes; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; microclimate; vegetation disturbance; climate; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the case of milled harvested peatlands, the pioneer moss Polytrichum strictum is commonly found; it is well adapted to tolerate the harsh microclimatic conditions and peat instability of these sites. A field experiment was used to determine the effectiveness of P. strictum against frost heaving, a major type of disturbance on bare peat. Wooden dowels and fir trees (Abies balsamea) placed in a P. strictum carpet experienced almost no frost heaving, whereas heaving was severe on bare peat. Reintroduced P. strictum fragments thinly spread on bare peat reduced but did not eliminate frost heaving. Straw mulch (a protective cover often required in peatland restoration) effectively reduced heaving in the fall, but was less effective in the spring because it had partially decomposed. The P. strictum carpet, P. strictum fragments, and straw mulch reduced frost heaving by reducing the number of freeze?thaw cycles, by slowing the rate of ground thaw in the spring, and by reducing the unfrozen water content of the peat during the spring thaw. Different species of Polytrichum mosses should be considered for the restoration or regeneration of disturbed ecosystems where soil stability is problematic.","2005-03-01","2025-02-18 19:49:13","2025-03-07 18:20:42","2025-02-18","74-82","","1","13","","Restoration Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.2","2","SC: 0000102  Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates how Polytrichum strictum acts as a nurse plant for Sphagnum by limiting needle ice damage.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; peat; substrate disturbance; bryophytes; mitigation hierarchy; substrate rehabilitation; vegetation disturbance; substrate; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These challenges are exemplified by the sedentary and migratory ecotypes of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). In Ontario, Canada, reliable discrimination based on morphology, pelage, or genetics has been unsuccessful. We tested the discriminatory power of locational and movement metrics as candidate indicators of discrete behaviours for 132 GPS-tracked female caribou. We assigned each animal to an ecotype each year using two variables which demonstrated the strongest bi-modality and the best discriminatory power: percent of calving season locations within the Hudson Bay Lowland and mean distance to treeline during calving season. The analysis revealed two distinct modes. None of 101 caribou tracked for more than 1year switched behaviours, implying the distinction may be permanent. Although there was no significant difference in morphology between ecotypes, mean aggregation metrics and calving dates were significantly different. Geographic distribution of these ecotypes showed substantial range overlap, particularly during winter, which presents challenges for conservation of the sedentary ecotype, a threatened designatable unit under federal and provincial legislation. Woodland caribou − with its cryptic ecotypes, discernible from differences in spatial behaviour − illustrate the importance of this type of analysis for identifying significant units for protection, understanding habitat relationships, and delineating ranges for habitat protection.","2016-02-01","2025-02-18 21:05:17","2025-03-12 01:49:52","","139-148","","","194","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.9","1","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper tracks female caribou from the eastern migratory and boreal populations and demonstrate overlap in distribution bu low overlap in populations and calving.</p> </div>","","","Canada; species-at-risk; Ontario; peatland; caribou; caribou, boreal population; Boreal Shield; caribou, eastern migratory population; fauna; mammals; Hudson Bay Lowland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The forest-tundra and forest-dwelling ecotypes of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in Ontario, Canada, are traditionally presumed to differ in migratory strategy; however, their potential for facultative migration, the practice of interannual switching between migratory and non-migratory strategies, has yet to be explored. Understanding facultative migration, and any inherent variation and influences could help improve habitat management. We acquired global positioning system (GPS) telemetry-based movement data from 109 radio-collared caribou across the Hudson Bay lowlands between 2009 and 2019. We compared the data with estimates of vegetation density, snow cover, and human disturbance to identify environmental influences associated with the probability and magnitude of migration. We also compared seasonal resource selection between migratory and sedentary individuals. Caribou demonstrated plasticity in migration, with evidence of facultative migration by the forest-tundra and the forest-dwelling ecotypes. Variation in migration was likely a combination of local adaptation and acute response to changing environmental factors, particularly snow. Probability and distance of migration were positively correlated with snow, while distance also showed spatial dependency. Plasticity in migration has significant implications in relation to future shifts in climate and should be considered in relevant predictive analyses.","2024-11","2025-02-18 21:12:46","2025-03-07 18:27:48","","","","8","88","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001288961200001","2.3","2","SC: 0000000","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the migration of eastern migratory vs boreal populations of woodland caribou in Ontario.</p> </div>","","","Canada; species-at-risk; Ontario; caribou; caribou, boreal population; Boreal Shield; caribou, eastern migratory population; fauna; mammals; Hudson Bay Lowland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research has focused on the consistency in the use of the same birth-site across years (i.e., spatial fidelity), but individuals alternatively may use similar habitat conditions across years (i.e., habitat fidelity). Using GPS telemetry, we determined whether woodland caribou expressed spatial or habitat fidelity during calving, and evaluated intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with expressing either type of fidelity. We identified 56 individuals with >= 2 putative birth events, via a movement-based model, across northern Ontario between 2010 and 2014. Individuals were classified as expressing (1) spatial fidelity by comparing sequential calving locations to a random spatial distribution of available calving locations, (2) habitat fidelity using a logistic use model compared to a null (intercept only) model, (3) no fidelity (neither criterion met), or (4) both spatial and habitat fidelity (both criteria met). Across all individuals, 37% expressed no fidelity (36 of 98), 15% expressed only spatial fidelity (15 of 99), 35% expressed only habitat fidelity (34 of 98), and 14% expressed both spatial and habitat fidelity (14 of 98). Older individuals were more likely to express spatial fidelity, whereas lower availability of upland and lowland conifer forests without linear features increased the probability an individual expressed habitat fidelity. Our results indicate that managing for caribou calving needs to consider protecting both specific, known birthing sites, but also broad-scale areas of preferred habitat for calving. Understanding the mechanisms that influence caribou expressing calving fidelity, and associated fitness costs, is crucial for the conservation of the species.","2024-06","2025-02-18 21:12:46","2025-03-12 01:49:49","","","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001235815000001","2.6","2","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the calving fidelity of the eastern migratory population versus the boreal population.</p> </div>","","","Canada; species-at-risk; Ontario; peatland; caribou; caribou, boreal population; Boreal Shield; caribou, eastern migratory population; fauna; mammals; Hudson Bay Lowland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the response of forest vegetation to high density of herbivores has been well studied, far less is known about peatland vegetation. In this paper, we assessed the long term impact of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on plant communities of ombrotrophic (bog) and minerotrophic (fen) peatlands in eastern North America. Vegetation of five peatlands that have experienced high deer densities for at least 75 years was compared with that of five peatlands situated at proximity but on deer-free islands. We investigated deer impacts on plant species composition and cover, shrub height and cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) fruit/flower production and morphology. In bogs, white-tailed deer had no long term impact on plant species assemblages, but reduced lichen cover and increased sedges and grasses cover as well as the surface area of bare peat. On the other hand, the floristic composition of fens differed significantly between sites where deer were present or absent. Plant diversity was greater in undisturbed fens than in disturbed fens, especially for shrubs, sedges and liverworts. No detrimental effects of browsing on shrub height were observed.

Stream-scale studies have revealed that specific landscape properties, such as wetlands or lakes, are hotspots for Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) loading, sinks and transformation, but we still do not know how they operate at the whole network scale and over large geographic gradients. In this study, we evaluate how landscape metrics are related to riverine concentrations and yields of total Hg and MeHg in 18 large boreal rivers draining watersheds ranging from 44 to 209,453 km(2), distributed along a 650 km latitudinal transect in the James Bay region of Quebec. Our analyses of landscape metrics using elastic net models and mixed models reinforce the role of wetlands as sources of MeHg, but further show that surface coverage of water in the watershed is the major driver of both Hg and MeHg concentrations and fluxes at the whole network scale. Our findings also demonstrate that seasonality modulates the relationship between landscape properties and Hg forms. Based on hydrologic data, we additionally estimate annual fluxes for the whole Eastern James Bay to 441 kg Hg and 14.6 kg MeHg, and average landscape yield to 1.24 g Hg km(-2) y(-1) and 0.041 g MeHg km(-2) y(-1).

Recent multivariate analyses have shown that weather and climate factors (e.g. temperatures, sea ice conditions) are related to total Hg (THg) concentrations in wildlife tissues, though relatively few studies have explored these relationships. The present study compared time series of THg concentrations in liver of polar bear (Ursus maritimus, 2007/08-2015/16), eggs of thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia, 1993-2015) and kidney of caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus, 2006-2015) from the Hudson Bay region of Canada and statistically modelled THg over time with available climate and weather data. Significant temporal trends of THg concentrations were not detected in any species. However, in multivariate models that included time-lagged sea ice freeze up dates, THg concentrations increased 4.4% yr(-1) in Qamanirjuaq caribou. Sea ice conditions were also related to THg levels in polar bear liver but not those in eggs of murres, though year was not a signifcant factor. Greater precipitation levels one to two years prior to sampling were associated with greater THg concentrations in polar bears and caribou, likely due to greater deposition, flooding and discharge from nearby wetlands and rivers. Time-lagged Arctic and/or North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO) indices also generated significant, inverse models for all three species, agreeing with relationships in other time series of similar length. The magnitude and direction of many relationships were affected by season, duration of time-lags, and the length of the time series. Our findings support recent observations suggesting that temporal studies monitoring Hg in Arctic wildlife should consider including key climatic or weather factors to help identify consistent variables of influence and to improve temporal analyses of THg time series.","2022-05-01","2025-02-20 22:21:07","2025-03-12 01:49:53","2022-02-25","","","","207","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000751900700002","8.3","2","SC: 0000018  Gamberg Consulting","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper relates the accumulation of mercury in tissues of polar bear, caribou and seabirds in the Hudson Bay region on climatic factors, and the possible effects of climate warming.</p> </div>","","","Canada; species-at-risk; climate change; coastal ecosystem; caribou; polar bear; metal/metalloid; mammals; Hudson Bay Lowland; climate; fertility change/contamination; mercury/methylmercury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shorebirds, key predators at coastal wetlands, have experienced widespread population declines and could be negatively affected by droughts. We explored, in detail, the effects of drought on multiple aspects of shorebird stopover and migration ecology by contrasting a year with average wet/dry conditions (2016) with a year with moderate drought (2017) at a major subarctic stopover site on southbound migration. We also examined the effects of drought on shorebird body mass during stopover across 14 years (historical: 1974-1982 and present-day: 2014-2018). For the detailed comparison of two years, in the year with moderate drought we documented lower invertebrate abundance at some sites, higher prey family richness in shorebird faecal samples, lower shorebird refuelling rates, shorter stopover durations for juveniles, and, for most species, a higher probability of making a subsequent stopover in North America after departing the subarctic, compared to the year with average wet/dry conditions. In the 14-year dataset, shorebird body mass tended to be lower in drier years. We show that even short-term, moderate drought conditions can negatively affect shorebird refuelling performance at coastal wetlands, which may carry-over to affect subsequent stopover decisions. Given shorebird population declines and predicted changes in the severity and duration of droughts with climate change, researchers should prioritize a better understanding of how droughts affect shorebird refuelling performance and survival.","2021-11","2025-02-20 22:21:07","2025-03-11 18:35:21","2021-10-25","661-674","","3","197","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000707683000001","2.7","2","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of drouughht</p> </div>","","","climate change; other wetland; drawdown; coastal ecosystem; migratory birds; fauna; shorebird; birds; saltmarsh; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Across the tundra on the Hudson Bay Lowlands, extensive foraging by lesser snow goose populations has been driving alterations to the landscape. Here, I show that this widespread and dramatic disturbance increases evaporation rates of ephemeral ponds and consequently constricts the temporal availability of seasonal aquatic habitats for larval mosquitoes. I also show that this constriction decreases the temporal diversity of closely related univoltine mosquito species that have varying emergence schedules. Three species of mosquitoes emerged through the season from four sampled ephemeral ponds associated with no goose grubbing; only one species emerged, early in the season, from the four ponds that experienced heavy grubbing. This study demonstrates a mechanism for temporal composition change in a ubiquitous and abundant group of arthropods on the tundra. It does not show life history evolution of emergence time of mosquitoes; however, it highlights the rather unexplored role of ecological interactions in altering the diversity of phenologies across seasonal time.","2017-03","2025-02-20 22:21:07","2025-03-07 21:59:19","2017-04-07","553-561","","3","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000395177000005","1.7","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the impact of overgrazing and consequent saltmarsh degradation on the hydroperiod of ephemeral ponds and the consequences for mosquitoes.</p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; migratory birds; arthropods; fauna; Hudson Bay Lowland; birds; pools/ponds; snow goose; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined hair total Hg (THg) concentrations in 24 polar bear family groups in western Hudson Bay: mother, cub-of-the-year (COY), yearling, and 2 year old. THg concentrations increased with bear age, with COYs having lower concentrations than other offspring groups (p <= 0.008). Using AICc-based regression models, we found maternal THg to be positively related to body condition and litter size, while overall offspring THg was positively related to maternal body condition in addition to being dependent on the sex and age of the offspring.

These changes likely represent an example of an alternative stable state; however, long-term datasets documenting whether revegetation is occurring are scarce. Here, we report results of a 10-year study investigating changes in the state of a degraded salt marsh system on the north coast of Akimiski Island, Nunavut. Four transects were intensively sampled in 1998 and 2008, two within the dense nesting and brood-rearing area of a snow geese colony, one on the colony edge, and one outside it; all of these sites were also used by broods of Canada geese. Key forage species (Puccinellia phryganodes, Festuca rubra, Carex subspathacea) were less common near the colony center than elsewhere; biomass of Puccinellia also tended to be lower in more central areas. Forage species often increased in abundance between samplings, but the magnitude of changes was small. In contrast, non-forage species (Salicornia, Spergularia, Glaux) often reached high abundance within the colony center; some (Salicornia) decreased while others (Spergularia) increased. We argue the degraded state was initiated by foraging damage from an exceptional stopover of 295,000 staging birds in 1972 and that the combined foraging pressure of relatively small numbers of nesting and migrant geese since then, coupled with soil changes, has been sufficient to maintain devegetated areas as a persistent alternative state. Whether or not this state is truly stable, further recovery is likely to be very slow.","2013-03","2025-02-20 22:21:07","2025-03-12 01:49:49","2013-03-27","409-422","","3","214","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000315491300006","1.7","4","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the long-term changes in saltmarsh vegetation as a result of overgrazing by Canada geese and snow geese in the James Bay region of the Hudson Bay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; vegetation; vascular plants; coastal ecosystem; migratory birds; fauna; Hudson Bay Lowland; birds; graminoids; saltmarsh; Canada goose; snow goose; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within these regions, the Hudson Bay Lowlands are home to an overabundant breeding population of lesser snow geese that has dramatically damaged the ecosystem, with cascading effects at multiple trophic levels. In some areas the overabundance of geese has led to a drastic reduction in available forage. In addition, warming of this region has widened the gap between goose migration timing and plant green-up, and this mismatch between goose and plant phenologies could in turn affect gosling development. The dual effects of climate change and habitat quality on gosling body condition and juvenile survival are not known, but are critical for predicting population growth and related degradation of (sub) arctic ecosystems. To address these issues, we used information on female goslings marked and measured between 1978 and 2005 (4125 individuals). Goslings that developed within and near the traditional center of the breeding colony experienced the effects of long-term habitat degradation: body condition and juvenile survival declined over time. In newly colonized areas, however, we observed the opposite pattern (increase in body condition and juvenile survival). In addition, warmer than average winters and summers resulted in lower gosling body condition and first-year survival. Too few plant growing days in the spring relative to hatch led to similar results. Our assessment indicates that geese are recovering from habitat degradation by moving to newly colonized locales. However, a warmer climate could negatively affect snow goose populations in the long-run, but it will depend on which seasons warm the fastest. These antagonistic mechanisms will require further study to help predict snow goose population dynamics and manage the trophic cascade they induce.","2013-01","2025-02-20 22:21:08","2025-03-07 21:59:19","2013-01-09","149-160","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000312155100012","11.6","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- &nbsp;This paper examines the effects of saltmarsh destruction and its cascading effects on juvenile survival of lesser snow geese in the Hudson Bay Lowland </p> </div>","","","Canada; vegetation; other wetland; coastal ecosystem; migratory birds; fauna; vegetation disturbance; Hudson Bay Lowland; birds; saltmarsh; snow goose; food web; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Environmental degradation can change resource use strategies of animals and thereby affect survival and fitness. Arctic herbivores may be especially susceptible to the effects of such environmental change because their rapid growth rates demand high-quality forage, which may be limited as environmental conditions deteriorate. We studied the consequences of a trophic cascade, driven by Lesser Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) overgrazing on the south-west coast of Hudson Bay, Canada, which has caused tidal marsh (TM) degradation and the reduction in high-quality forage plants, on gosling growth and resource use. 2. We compared resource use and body size of goslings that inhabited tidal and freshwater marsh (FM) to determine how current foraging strategies influence growth and to test the hypothesis that during early growth goslings require and so consume high-quality TM plants, but that during later growth they may switch to foraging in lower-quality FM. 3. To investigate gosling resource use throughout growth, we measured once a week for 28 days the body size of goslings as well as stable isotope ratios (d34S, d15N and d13C) in multiple tissues of goslings that were collected from both TM and nearby FM. We also measured the stable isotope ratios in forage plants sampled along transects and from gosling foreguts. We used an isotope-mixing model to determine the contribution of FM plants to gosling tissues. 4. Contrary to the proposed hypothesis, goslings inhabiting FM or TM primarily consumed FM plants during early growth. Furthermore, goslings that foraged extensively in FM had similar growth rates and grew to a similar size and body mass, as goslings that foraged in the degraded TM. However, goslings that currently inhabit freshwater or TM were significantly smaller than goslings that inhabited TM in the 1980s prior to habitat degradation. 5. Consequences of smaller overall body size include decreased survival and fecundity for arctic-nesting geese. The ability of phenotypically plastic responses to sustain persistence is limited by reaction norms and the extent of environmental change. Current research is assessing whether those limits have been reached in this system.","2012-09","2025-02-20 22:21:08","2025-03-12 01:49:49","2012-09-26","1132-1142","","5","81","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000307343100023","4.8","1","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper assess whether overgrazing and consequent wetland degradation in turns affects the fitness of snow geese.</p> </div>","","","Canada; vegetation; other wetland; coastal ecosystem; migratory birds; fauna; Hudson Bay Lowland; birds; saltmarsh; marsh; snow goose; food web; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An episode of mass fish mortality in the Sutton River in the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) of Northern Ontario has elicited the interest of the scientific community. Several lakes were sampled over three years in an effort to better understand and document the changes that may be occurring in these lakes. This study uses sediment cores to assess the history of mercury (Hg) deposition and to assess changes occurring in autochthonous productivity in these lakes. Sediments deposited after the onset of the industrial revolution contained significantly higher concentrations of Hg, with the highest concentrations found in the most recently deposited sediments. Hg concentrations in these pristine lakes rival those of lakes in heavily urbanized areas, indicating that they are in fact subjected to atmospheric deposition of Hg. There was a large variation in [Hg] of the surface sediments of 13 lakes; underscoring the importance of in situ processes in the fate of atmospherically deposited Hg. Methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations were not correlated with total mercury concentrations (THg), demonstrating how THg is a poor predictor of MeHg; the bioaccumulative neurotoxic form of mercury. The S2 fraction of Rock-Eval® Pyrolysis, C:N ratios and ∂13C signatures were used as proxies of autochthonous carbon and all indicated that the lakes have become increasingly productive, presumably due to warmer water temperatures and longer ice-free seasons. Additionally, I use molecular techniques to detect and quantify the merA gene in the sediment; a proxy of bacterial mercury resistance involved in redox transformations. In Aquatuk, Hawley and North Raft Lakes, I observed a subsurface increase in merA genes in the sediment core, independently of a control gene and the [THg]. While I have not been able to explain the driving variables of this subsurface increase, I believe that the role of merA within remote lake sediments deserves further work. Lastly, microcosms were used to measure the production of volatile elemental mercury (Hg(0)) from surface sediments of Aquatuk Lake. I used a combination of analytical and molecular techniques to show that the production of Hg(0) is biogenic and tested the effect of nutrients, pH and ionic strength on the Hg(0) production rates. Ionic strength alone had the greatest impact on Hg(0) production rates, with increased Hg(0) production as ionic strength increases.","2012","2025-02-20 22:21:08","2025-03-12 01:56:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Ottawa","Ottawa","","","M.

In this study, we quantified concentrations of total mercury (THg) in the hair of polar bears from Canadian high- (southern Beaufort Sea, SBS) and sub- (western Hudson Bay, WHB) Arctic populations. Concentrations of THg in polar bears from the SBS population (14.8 +/- 6.6 mu g g(-1)) were significantly higher than in polar bears from WHB (4.1 +/- 1.0 mu g g(-1)). On the basis of delta N-15 signatures in hair, in conjunction with published delta N-15 signatures in particulate organic matter and sediments, we estimated that the pelagic and benthic food webs in the SBS are similar to 4.7 and similar to 4.0 trophic levels long, whereas in WHB they are only similar to 3.6 and similar to 3.3 trophic levels long. Furthermore, the more depleted delta C-13 ratios in hair from SBS polar bears relative to those from VVHB suggests that SBS polar bears feed on food webs that are relatively more pelagic (and longer), whereas polar bears from WHB feed on those that are relatively more benthic (and shorter). Food web length and structure accounted for similar to 67% of the variation we found in THg concentrations ampng all polar bears across both populations. The regional difference in polar bear hair THg concentrations was also likely Le to regional differences in water-column concentrations of methyl Hg (the toxic form of Hg that biomagnifies through food webs) available for bioaccumulation at the base of the food webs. For example, concentrations of methylated Hg at mid-depths in the marine water column of the northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago were 79.8 +/- 37.3 pg L-1, whereas, in HE, they averaged only 38.3 +/- 16.6 pg L-1. We conclude that a longer food web and higher pelagic concentrations of methylated Hg available to initiate bioaccumulation in the BS resulted in higher concentrations of THg in polar bears from the SBS region compared to those inhabiting the western coast of HB.","2011-07-15","2025-02-20 22:21:08","2025-03-07 21:59:20","2011-07-15","5922-5928","","14","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11.4","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the tissue mercury concentrations in polar bears in the high Arctic as compared to the subarctic, including from areas of the Hudson Bay Lowland. </p> </div>","","","Canada; species-at-risk; coastal ecosystem; polar bear; metal/metalloid; fauna; Hudson Bay Lowland; fertility change/contamination; food web; mercury/methylmercury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Breeding Nelson's Sparrows in North Dakota exhibited blood Hg levels 4.9 times as high as those from birds breeding along James Bay and 7.6 times as high as those wintering in North Carolina. These results provide significant insight on the timing of molt in this species as well as how Hg exposure varies regionally and seasonally for these birds.

We investigated whether short plants are primarily a plastic morphological response to grazing by geese. Over two growing seasons, we measured growth of short patches protected from grazing and of tall patches subjected to mowing treatments, with unmanipulated short and tall controls. Protection resulted in rapid conversion from a short growth form to a tall form, similar in height and biomass to plants in tall control plots. Mowed tall plants also rapidly recovered to near tall control values for height and biomass. A single 3 week treatment episode often permitted nearly full recovery to tall form. In some cases, more sustained protection was required, but repeated mowing ultimately may have reduced growth rates. These results indicate that the morphology of individual plants of Festuca rubra plastically recovers from changes in defoliation pressure.

In the coastal marshes of Hudson and James bays, foraging by increasing numbers of lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens A.O.U.) has led to loss of vegetation, and exposure and partial erosion of sediment.2 Multi-temporal analysis of LANDSAT data has been carried out to detect vegetation change from 1973 to 1999 or later at nine sites in the coastal marshes of these bays where staging and/or breeding geese are present annually.3 Images were co-registered, and for each image NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index) channels were generated. For each location, pairwise normalized differences were calculated between these NDVI images for each successive period defined by the imagery acquisition dates. The resulting secondary NDVI difference images expressed changes in NDVI values for each time interval and yielded three well-defined classes: water, vegetation decline and no detectable change in vegetation.4 At the nine widely separated study sites, the intertidal saltmarsh (an ecological sere) has been lost (to a total of 35 000 ha) and an alternative stable state (exposed sediment) established. Similar changes have occurred elsewhere along the 2000-km coastline where the geese breed or stage.5 Re-vegetation of these coastal marshes will take decades because of near-irreversible changes in soil properties that require erosion and re-deposition of unconsolidated sediment before large-scale plant colonization can occur, and because large numbers of geese continue to forage annually producing this dramatic top-down effect.","2006-01","2025-02-20 22:21:08","2025-03-07 21:59:18","2006-01-01","234-242","","1","94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000234028800022","5.5","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper summarizes the effects of overgrazing by snow geese on the saltmarshes and other wetlands of the Hudson Bay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; vegetation; other wetland; coastal ecosystem; migratory birds; fauna; Hudson Bay Lowland; birds; saltmarsh; marsh; snow goose; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rise in numbers complements the increased use of nitrogen fertilizers and a corresponding rise in yields of rice, corn, and wheat along the flyways and on the wintering grounds. In sub-Arctic migration areas and at Arctic breeding colonies, foraging by high numbers of birds has led to loss of coastal vegetation, adverse changes in soil properties and the establishment of an alternative stable state of exposed sediment, which can be detected with LANDSAT imagery. At a local scale, gosling growth, size and survival decreased in affected areas and other taxa have been adversely affected. The food subsidy on wintering and migration areas appears insufficient to meet reproductive demands as foraging in spring continues to occur on southern Hudson Bay staging and nesting areas. The recent introduction of liberal hunting regulations may reduce population size in the near term, but the revegetation of these coastal ecosystems will take decades to achieve.

Foraging by geese has led to vegetation loss in salt marshes along the Hudson Bay coast and lesser snow geese are increasingly grazing inland freshwater marshes. We determined whether different nutrients limit the growth of forage plants in the two habitats, and whether these differences affect the nutritional quality of vegetation available to geese at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba. 2. Results from fertilization experiments indicate that primary productivity in the salt marsh is both nitrogen and phosphorus limited, whereas the freshwater marsh is phosphorus limited. Total amounts of calcium, magnesium and potassium in above-ground biomass per unit area showed similar differences in limitation.3. Leaves of preferred forage species have higher nutrient concentrations (nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium) and lower C : N and C : P ratios than alternative forage. The main forage species in the salt marsh (Puccinellia phryganodes) has higher nutrient content per unit mass, for nitrogen, magnesium, calcium and sodium, than the major freshwater marsh species(Carex aquatilis). The difference in nutritional quality of forage between the marshes is likely to have had consequences for goose fitness, and may have contributed to the reported declines in gosling survivorship and size. 4. At moderate grazing intensities, seasonal growth of salt-marsh forage is maintained by addition of nitrogen and, to a lesser extent, phosphorus from high numbers of goose faeces to swards. In contrast, the low densities and low phosphorus content of goose faeces in the phosphorus-limited freshwater marsh mean that plants are unlikely to recover rapidly from the effects of grazing. As a consequence, the freshwater marsh is likely to become increasingly less productive as foraging intensifies. 5. Nutrient gradients in vegetation across an ecotone and changes in foraging behaviour have resulted in adverse effects on both the growth rates of individuals and the population structure of a herbivore.","2004-12","2025-02-20 22:21:08","2025-03-12 01:49:49","2004-12-01","1001-1010","","6","92","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.5","1","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper determines that N and P are limiting nutrients in saltmarsh and freshwater marsh in the coastal Hudson Bay Lowland.

Soil properties of the alternate states were measured in conjunction with the ability of transplanted tillers of Puccinellia phryganodes to grow in exposed soil and intact swards. Simulated grubbed patches (2.5-40 cm diameter) were prepared at three sites and the soil properties and inward clonal growth of the grass in each patch were examined during two growing seasons.3 Where an organic layer was still present on exposed areas, soil properties were similar to those in the rooting zone beneath intact swards, except that soils were hyper-rather than hyposaline. Older exposed mineral soils, where the organic layer had been eroded, were similarly hypersaline, but were also low in soil moisture and total nitrogen, and compacted with a low infiltration rate. Transplanted tillers survived in intact swards, but few survived in any hypersaline soils.4 Changes in soil properties over two seasons depended on size of experimentally created patches. Again, high salinities developed in soils of the larger patches, and there was a loss of nitrogen and soil moisture and an increase in bulk density with increasing patch size. Although inward clonal growth of P. phryganodes took place from plot perimeters, this is likely to be curtailed by high salinities in plots over 20 cm diameter.5 As in tropical Africa, intense herbivory can lead to an alternate stable state in this Arctic salt marsh. Small patches of exposed soil are characterized by deteriorating soil conditions and the inability of vegetation to re-establish. As patches coalesce with continued herbivory, an ecological sere (the intertidal salt marsh) is lost.","2004-08","2025-02-20 22:21:08","2025-03-07 21:59:19","2004-08-01","648-660","","4","92","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000222869400009","5.5","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper summarizes the effects of overgrazing by snow geese on the vegetation and mud flats in salt marsh in the Hudson Bay Lowland. </p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; vegetation; migratory birds; salinity; fauna; vegetation disturbance; Hudson Bay Lowland; birds; saltmarsh; snow goose; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This system shows two alternate stable states: (a) lawns that either support a foraging population of lesser snow geese, or are not grazed by geese; and (b) exposed saline sediments that support little or no vegetation. The model represents the flow of N from cyanobacterial fixation, the major N input into the system, to the geese that migrate in autumn; those that do not return represent the major N output from the system. We have modelled N fixation, the transformations of N in the soil, plant growth, lawn regeneration, and goose grazing and grubbing.2 The model simulates steady-state flows of N similar to those observed in the field at zero and at moderate goose density, and it also simulates the transition to the state of zero plant biomass, a consequence of increased grubbing at high goose density. The simulated steady-state flows are found to be more sensitive to changes in the parameters that describe N fixation and goose biology, than to similar changes in the parameters describing plant biology.3 Because the model shows the alternate stable states and the transition between them, with values for the state variables that are consistent with field data, we conclude that N dynamics are crucial in determining the stability of the real salt marsh-goose system. The determining factor is the loss of the input of N from fixation when lawn area is reduced because the rate of goose grubbing exceeds that of plant re-establishment.","2003-08","2025-02-20 22:21:08","2025-03-11 18:28:15","2003-08-01","637-650","","4","91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000184268300012","5.5","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates the N dynamics in saltmarsh in the Hudson Bay Lowland from bacterial nitrogen fixation to plant uptake and herbivory in saltmarsh of the Hudson Bay Lowland. </p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; vegetation; other wetland; microbial activity; nutrients; migratory birds; fauna; Hudson Bay Lowland; birds; saltmarsh; fertility change/contamination; snow goose; food web; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The influence of various environmental conditions such as lake pH, DOC, and chemical speciation of Hg, on fish-Hg concentrations and Hg exposure in fish-eating wildlife, are discussed. Although a continuing global effort to decrease the release of this nonessential metal into the environment is warranted, Hg methylation and biomagnification may be limited in some environments due to chemical speciation of mercury in soils and sediments (e.g., HgS) and water quality conditions (e.g., high alkalinity and pH) that do not facilitate high methylation rates. We have shown such limitations for a lake where historic Hg mining greatly increased sediment-Hg loadings, yet Hg increases in small fish of various species are currently lower than expected, and top predators (bald eagles), despite having elevated concentrations of Hg in their blood compared with individuals from nearby lakes, exhibit no Hg-related reproductive impairment or other signs of MeHg intoxication. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that fish-eating human populations may be exposed to Hg sufficient to cause significant developmental effects. However, for humans, we conclude that the current USEPA reference dose for MeHg may be too restrictive, particularly for the less sensitive adult. The health status of indigenous peoples relying on the subsistence harvest of wild foods may be negatively affected by such restrictions.","2003-06","2025-02-20 22:21:08","2025-03-07 21:59:20","2003-06-01","867-883","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000184958300011","4.3","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- &nbsp;This paper reviews our current knowledge on the effects of mercury on fish-eating birds, mammals, and humans associated with freshwater ecosystems.</p> </div>","","","pollution; fish; wild foods; metal/metalloid; fertility change/contamination; food web; mercury/methylmercury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most sites within the marsh are devoid of vegetation, and organic-rich saline sediments are exposed. The loss has affected soil invertebrate assemblages, particularly spiders and beetles that are an important food source for shorebirds and passerines. Above-ground terrestrial invertebrates were collected in the summer of 1997 from pan traps at three sites established within a supratidal marsh. Only one area of relatively undamaged salt marsh remained within this supratidal marsh. The selected 3 sites were a degraded area, an undamaged salt marsh, and a brackish, riverine marsh. In the degraded area, plant cover was less than 2%, surface soil temperatures were high, and sediments were less aerobic and were dried out in summer compared to those from the undamaged area and the riverine marsh. Spiders were most numerous in the undamaged area and least abundant in the degraded area; numbers declined at all locations in late summer. Beetles showed the same seasonal trend, but the highest and lowest densities were recorded in the riverine marsh and in degraded area, respectively. With the exception of a few species, most of these invertebrates were boreal rather than Arctic in their distribution ranges. Overall, the results clearly show that spiders and beetles are sensitive to loss of vegetation and changes in environmental conditions.

This decline coincides with a 63% reduction in vegetation cover in the-bird's preferred grassland-shrub habitat. The habitat degradation resulted from processes associated with destructive foraging by the increasing mid-continent population of lesser snow geese during their breeding season. Growth of this snow goose population has been initiated and sustained by a series of anthropogenic factors operating primarily on the snow goose wintering grounds, far south of these Arctic coastal habitats. Thus, the indirect human impact on nesting-by savannah sparrows is the result of a complex chain of ecological events operating on connected habitats across a large geographical expanse. Mitigation of such effects and an assessment of the impacts in general must take into account such complexities.","2003","2025-02-20 22:21:08","2025-03-12 01:49:51","2003-01-01","33-37","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000182155200005","1.3","4","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of destruction of willow scrub and freshwater marsh by snow geese on the populations of savanna sparrows in the Hudson Bay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; vegetation; other wetland; migratory birds; fauna; vegetation disturbance; Hudson Bay Lowland; woody plants; birds; marsh; snow goose; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe the long-term effects of increasing numbers of geese at an arctic breeding ground (La Pérouse Bay, Manitoba) on intertidal salt-marsh vegetation. Between 1985 and 1999 goose grubbing caused considerable loss of graminoid vegetation along transects in intertidal marshes. Loss of vegetation led to bare sediment with a plant cover of less than 2%. Changes in vegetation could not be described by simple linear, geometric or exponential functions; most losses occurred between 1988 and 1990 and losses were staggered in time between individual transects, some of which had all vegetation removed. Between 1979 and 1999 the standing crop in July in remaining intact heavily-grazed swards of Puccinellia phry-ganodes and Carex subspathacea fell from 40–60 g m-2 to 20–30 g m-2. Intense grazing on remaining patches of sward has restricted growth of these clonal forage plants and hypersalinity of bare sediments has precluded re-establishment of vegetation. Between 1989 and 1993 numbers of faecal droppings in grazed plots reached maximum values of 15–22 droppings m-2 wk-1. Since then peak values have remained at less than 13 droppings m-2 wk-1. The loss of vegetation and changes in soil conditions have resulted in the establishment of an alternative stable state (hypersaline bare sediment).","2002-05","2025-02-20 22:21:08","2025-03-12 01:49:48","2002-05-01","7-16","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000176407800002","2.8","3","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper summarizes the effects of overgrazing by snow geese on the saltmarsh vegetation and substrate in the Hudson Bay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; vegetation; vascular plants; other wetland; substrate disturbance; coastal ecosystem; migratory birds; fauna; Hudson Bay Lowland; birds; graminoids; saltmarsh; snow goose; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In moist intertidal soils, vegetative fragments of the asexual species Puccinellia phryganodes readily established and formed a mat in exclosures (5 years).4 Changes in species assemblages occurred over 11 years in exclosed and adjacent open plots in intertidal and supratidal marshes. Loss of vegetation cover and species richness, particularly dicotyledonous species, and the reversion of later successional plant assemblages to earlier successional assemblages occurred in open plots. In the absence of foraging, late successional graminoids and willow species replaced early successional graminoids.5 Late successional grasses of the upper intertidal marsh died when transplanted into degraded soils but still survived after one season in control plots, suggesting that an early successional template is needed for establishment.6 In the absence of goose foraging, natural re-vegetation by clonal propagation can occur only where edaphic conditions are suitable. Within exclosures, vegetation changes resemble those in undamaged areas where goose foraging pressure is still moderate.

Documentation of the extent, pattern, and timing of habitat damage over large spatial and temporal scales requires reconstruction of the previously-existing vegetation. Satellite imagery is increasingly used for mapping and monitoring vegetation change over large areas, and archives of Landsat imagery provide consistent, spatially-extensive historical data. Previously-existing vegetation at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, was mapped using unsupervised classification of a 1984 Landsat TM image and ancillary information. Using a commercial clustering algorithm, sixty-three spectral clusters were produced and subsequently identified using a combination of historical and current aerial photos, current vegetation data, and knowledge of local vegetation trajectories in time. These initial clusters were then aggregated into 14 classes, resulting in a detailed map of vegetation as it was before degradation by the geese. The map was compared to earlier results documenting change in the study area. Vegetation degradation between 1973 and 1993 occurred earliest and most extensively in the salt marsh and other classes containing salt marsh vegetation.

At coastal sites adjacent to the Hudson Bay lowlands, intensive foraging by increasing numbers of lesser snow geese Anser caerulescens caerulescens has converted salt-marsh swards to hypersaline mudflats largely devoid of vegetation. Assisted revegetation trials were undertaken in order to determine the ability of plants to establish in degraded salt-marsh sediments.2. Soil plugs of the former dominant graminoids, Puccinellia phryganodes and Cares subspathacea, were transplanted into plots of hypersaline bare soil. Some plots were treated with fertilizer and peat mulch to determine if ameliorations enhance plant growth.3. Transplants of P. phryganodes established in degraded sediments, but those treated with fertilizer and peat showed significantly higher growth than those in bare soil after two growing seasons. The ratio of the mean basal area of plants in treated plots compared with bare plots was between 1.7 and 4.0: 1 at different sites. Transplants of C. subspathacea did not establish readily in degraded sediments and no growth enhancement was observed with soil amendments.4. Growth rate and mortality of plants both varied between sites and years, reflecting variation in the frequency of hot, dry weather from late June to early August of each year, and the salinity and water content of soils during that period. The potential for revegetation of mudflats is discussed in the context of the soil degradation processes. Fine-grain variation in soil conditions presents a major challenge for the restoration of plant assemblages in these coastal marshes.5. The extent of soil degradation and of vegetation loss makes it unlikely that unassisted revegetation will occur at some sites, even in the absence of goose foraging, without erosion of consolidated sediments and the establishment of plant assemblages in fresh unconsolidated sediments.","2000-12","2025-02-20 22:21:08","2025-03-07 18:20:42","2000-12-01","944-958","","6","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000166979900006","5.7","1","SC: 0000070","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents transplant and amendment trials of saltmarsh in the Hudson bay Lowland affected by snow geese overgrazing.</p> </div>","","","Canada; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; other wetland; coastal ecosystem; active restoration; migratory birds; mitigation hierarchy; fauna; vegetation disturbance; Hudson Bay Lowland; birds; graminoids; saltmarsh; marsh; snow goose; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lesser snow geese initiate the process by grubbing for roots and rhizomes of salt-marsh graminoids (Puccinellia phryganodes and Carex subspathacea) in spring. The increased rates of evaporation from sediments beneath disturbed or destroyed swards in summer result in high soil salinities that adversely affect the growth of the remaining grazed plants. 2 Above-ground biomass and soil salinity differed between sites in the salt marsh. Soil salinity was inversely related to above-ground biomass and shoot density of Puccinellia phryganodes. Increased biomass led to reduced soil salinity at sites where exclosures were erected. 3 Plant growth, measured as the rate of leaf births on Puccinellia shoots, was reduced by high soil salinities at sites where exclosures were erected. 4 Leaf demography of transplanted experimental plants of Puccinellia differed in 1992, but not 1991, between plants transplanted into sites with different amounts of above-ground biomass. Leaf births and deaths were highest for plants grown in sites where above-ground biomass was high and lowest for plants transplanted into bare sites. Grazing had no effect on leaf demography in 1991 and only marginally increased the rate of leaf deaths in 1992. 5 Growth of transplanted individuals of Carex subspathacea was similarly highest at sites where the standing crop of Puccinellia and Carex was high and was lowest in bare sites. 6 Algal crusts, which formed on bare or poorly vegetated sites, also reduced the growth of Puccinellia plants. 7 The effects of this deleterious positive feedback on plant growth are discussed in relation to changes occurring in the lesser snow goose colonies at La Perouse Bay and elsewhere.","1996-02","2025-02-20 22:21:09","2025-03-11 18:29:08","1996-02-01","31-42","","1","84","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1996TV77700004","5.5","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper links snow goose overgrazing to salinization and consequent vegetation decline in the Hudson Bay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; vegetation; carbon cycle; primary productivity; migratory birds; salinity; fauna; vegetation disturbance; Hudson Bay Lowland; birds; saltmarsh; snow goose; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of clipping and addition of nitrogen on the growth in pots of individual tillers of this grass were also investigated in a factorial experiment designed to separate the effects of each treatment.  The experimental design of both investigations was closely based on the foraging behaviour of wild geese on Puccinellia swards.(2) The clipping of leaves per se which mimicked the leaf demography of shoots grazed by wild birds had a detrimental effect on shoot growth and NAPP.  Addition of nutrients ameliorated the adverse effects of clipping on shoot growth.  Plants which received nutrients, but whose leaves were not clipped, produced the highest amount of above-ground biomass.(3) During the summer of 1987 plots of Puccinellia were either grazed once every 12 days (one to six occasions), or once every 24 days (two or three occasions), or on three occasions at intervals of 12 days late in the season after the wild geese had left the marsh.  Plots grazed on three occasions at intervals of 12 days from late June to early August during the period of rapid growth of above-ground biomass most closely mimicked the foraging behaviour of the wild geese.(4) Seasonal cumulative NAPP in 1987 was significantly higher in plots grazed on three occasions than in ungrazed plots, plots grazed once, or plots grazed repeatedly throughout the season.  In 1988 plots were not grazed and a similar trend in NAPP was obtained, except that the NAPP of plots grazed late in the season in 1987 was low.  The departure of wild geese in early August may be necessary if swards are to recover from the effects of defoliation.(5) During the summer of 1987, forage quality (N content) and NAPP together were highest in plots grazed on three occasions at intervals of 12 days - the treatment closest to the foraging pattern of wild birds.  In July of the following summer shoot nitrogen content did not differ among the exclosed plots, irrespective of the treatment in 1987, and all values were lower than that for shoots from adjacent swards which were grazed and fertilized by wild geese.(6) The results show that NAPP and the nutritional quality of forage are dependent on faecal input, the number and timing of the grazing events and the phenology of plant growth.  The role of the herbivore in maintaining grazing lawns of Puccinellia is discussed.","1991-09","2025-02-20 22:21:09","2025-03-07 21:59:19","1991-09-01","715-730","","3","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.5","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of the timing of repeated grazing by snow geese on the primary production of graminoids in saltmarshes in the Hudson Bay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; vegetation; other wetland; carbon cycle; coastal ecosystem; primary productivity; migratory birds; fauna; vegetation disturbance; Hudson Bay Lowland; birds; saltmarsh; snow goose; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No premature leaf fall from undisturbed Salix was detected. Early leaf death was correlated with high foliar concentrations of sodium and chloride ions.(5) Salix from artificially grubbed areas failed to develop leaves the following season and 24 months after removal of turf plants were dead.(6) It is concluded that spring grubbing by geese initiates a series of environmental changes which make it unlikely that the original plant communities will reestablish in the foreseeable future (< 15 years).","1991-03","2025-02-20 22:21:09","2025-03-12 01:49:49","1991-03-01","61-73","","1","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1991GE97100004","5.5","1","SC: None[s0]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of simulate snow goose grazing and grubbing on willow communities inshore from saltmarshesalong the coast of the Hudson Bay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; vegetation; other wetland; coastal ecosystem; migratory birds; salinity; fauna; Hudson Bay Lowland; woody plants; birds; marsh; snow goose; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(3) Patterns of foraging varying space and time. In spring at the nesting sites, before the onset of above-ground growth of vegetation, adult geese grub for roots and rhizomes of graminoid plants in relatively dry areas, and in wet habitats they eat the swollen bases of shoots of sedges, particularly Carex aquatilis. In summer, adults and goslings graze intensively on leaves of grasses and sedges over wide areas. Swards dominated by Carex subspathecea are produced in brackish marshes, but the leaves of graminoids of the freshwater sedge meadows are also clipped extensively. (4) Grubbing of vegetation by geese each spring creates bare areas (1-5 m2) of peat and sediment. The increased numbers of birds have increased the scale of disturbance, with large areas no stripped of vegetation, particularly by the McConnell River. At some sites, erosion of peat has exposed the underlying glacial gravels. There is little likelihood that the vegetation with re-establishes will closley resemble the original.

Studies at other, more northern North American locations have shown grubbing by geese can have severe consequences for intertidal and supratidal marshes, but these studies have focussed on plant communities that differ substantially in species composition, physical environment, and extent from James Bay's Festuca meadows. In this study, we examined the responses of this grass to natural and simulated goose grubbing in Festuca swards heavily used by lesser snow geese, Canada geese, and brant at Akimiski Island in James Bay. We transplanted Festuca into plots previously devegetated by geese, into plots where we removed vegetation to simulate goose grubbing, and into intact vegetation (controls). We found shoots transplanted into control and artificially grubbed plots survived well, but those transplanted into previously devegetated areas usually died. Growth initially was reduced in naturally devegetated sites, but the few survivors in the following year performed as well as plants transplanted into intact or artificially grubbed sites. Spot measurements suggested that naturally devegetated sites suffered from degraded soil conditions, such as hypersalinity and increased temperature.

We assessed longterm changes in proportional ground cover and habitat patch characteristic at a subarctic supratidal marsh that was largely vacated by breeding snow geese over a decade ago. We found no evidence of habitat recovery. Rather, snow geese leave a legacy on the land that propagates degradation of habitat long after their direct removal of vegetation through foraging. Over a 35 year period, we documented a 46% reduction in graminoid cover and an 84% reduction in shrub cover, which led to smaller and more isolated patches of shrubs that many avian species depend upon for foraging and nesting.

We analyzed time series of detection/nondetection data using hierarchical models in a Bayesian multi-model inference framework to decompose the dynamics of species distributions into responses to environmental variability, spatial variation in habitat conditions, and population dynamics and interspecific interactions, while correcting for observation errors and variation in sampling regimes. We modeled distribution dynamics of 14 waterbird species (broadly defined, including wetland and riparian species) using data from two different breeding bird surveys collected in the Boreal Shield ecozone within Ontario, Canada. Temporal variation in species occupancy (2000?2006) was primarily driven by climatic variability. Only two species showed evidence of consistent temporal trends in distribution: Ring-necked Duck (Aythya collaris) decreased, and Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) increased. The models had good predictive ability on independent data over time (1997?1999). Spatial variation in species occupancy was strongly related to the distribution of specific land cover types and habitat disturbance: Fire and forest harvesting influenced occupancy more than did roads, settlements, or mines. Bioclimatic and habitat heterogeneity indices and geographic coordinates exerted negligible influence on most species distributions. Estimated habitat suitability indices had good predictive ability on spatially independent data (Hudson Bay Lowlands ecozone). Additionally, we detected effects of interspecific interactions. Species responses to fire and forest harvesting were similar for 13 of 14 species; thus, forest-harvesting practices in Ontario generally appeared to emulate the effects of fire for waterbirds over timescales of 10?20 years. Extrapolating to all 84 waterbird species breeding on the Ontario Boreal Shield, however, suggested that up to 30 species may instead have altered (short-term) distribution dynamics due to forestry practices. Hence, natural disturbances are critical components of the ecology of the boreal forest and forest practices which aim to approximate them may succeed in allowing the maintenance of the associated species, but improved monitoring and modeling of large-scale boreal forest bird distribution dynamics will be necessary to resolve existing uncertainties, especially on less-common species.","2014-01-01","2025-02-23 20:14:57","2025-03-12 01:56:40","2025-02-23","121-141","","1","24","","Ecological Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","1","SC: 0000030  Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of fire, various human disturbances, including forest harvest, settlements, mines and roads, as well as climate on the patterns of bird changes in the northern Ontario, including the Boreal Shield.</p> </div>","","","Canada; Ontario; peatland; other wetland; Boreal Shield; forest harvest; migratory birds; fauna; vegetation disturbance; Hudson Bay Lowland; birds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We surveyed published literature from the region to identify climate indicators associated with impacts on snowpacks, ponds, vegetation, and wood frogs. These climate indicators were calculated using statistically downscaled climate projections, and the potential impacts on ecosystem processes are discussed. While there is a strong trend towards longer and warmer summers, associated changes in the vegetation community mean that snowpacks are not necessarily decreasing, which is important for freshwater ponds dependent on snowmelt recharge.

Total Hg in wetland sediment was unrelated to MeHg concentrations of amphibian larvae, but sediment THg increased with from coastal tundra vegetation to inland boreal forests. Methylmercury concentrations of wood frog eggs (geometric mean = 35.9; range: 6.7–77.9 ng/g dry wt) exceeded previous reports for amphibians, including from sites contaminated by industrial sources of Hg. Methylmercury concentrations of adult wood frogs (298.9 ng/g dry wt) were also higher than that for frogs included in a recent assessment of MeHg in amphibians across the contiguous United States. Within wetlands, MeHg concentrations of wood frog larvae were strongly correlated with MeHg concentrations in eggs earlier in the summer, and concentrations increased with each life stage. We estimate there would have been 1,971.8–3,286.4 ng MeHg exported from wetlands by wood frog metamorphs, which is 3.4–5.6 times more MeHg than inputted by eggs.

The Mid-Continent Population of lesser snow geese, which breeds in the Canadian Arctic and which traditionally wintered in the coastal marshes of the Gulf States, now feeds in agricultural landscapes. The geometric growth of this population since 1970 is coincident with increased application of nitrogen to farmland and high crop yields. Widespread availability of agricultural foods allows the birds to meet much of their energy demand for migration and reproduction. Their migration conforms to a stepping stone model linked to land use, but feeding also takes place upon arrival on the Arctic breeding grounds. High bird numbers have dramatically affected coastal marshes of the Canadian Arctic. Foraging has produced alternative stable states characterized by sward destruction and near irreversible changes in soil properties of exposed sediments. Locally, this loss of resilience has adversely affected different groups of organisms, resulting in an apparent trophic cascade. A spring hunt was introduced in 1999 in an attempt to check population growth. The current annual cull is now thought to be higher than the replacement rate. Much of the decline of the Mid-Continent Population is probably linked to shooting, but the harassment of birds that fail to acquire sufficient food for reproduction may contribute. The agricultural food subsidy has led to a mismatch between this avian herbivore and its environment ? a consequence of migratory connectivity that links wintering and breeding grounds.","2003-12-01","2025-02-24 14:52:20","2025-03-07 21:59:18","2025-02-24","193-232","","4","11","","Environ.

Yet, most ecosystem models do not consider many of the feedback loops at play in natural ecosystems. Particularly those influenced by biota, beyond vegetation and to some extent microbes, are often neglected. As a first step towards a better integration of biotic influences into ecosystem models, we provide a broad overview of the various ways biota may influence feedback loops between the high-latitude biosphere and the atmosphere. We focus specifically on three key feedback loops between tundra and atmosphere (carbon dynamics, albedo and permafrost thaw) and the influences of three key ecosystem compartments (vegetation, decomposers and herbivores) on these. The influences of biota on ecosystem feedback loops are multifaceted and may appear patchy in both space and time. However, biota may still play important roles in modulating ecosystem feedback loops, and by including these dynamics into ecosystem models, magnitude, accuracy and credibility of model projections are likely to improve.","2024-12-20","2025-02-24 15:11:05","2025-03-12 12:52:51","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001388553100001","4.6","3 (低预警)","SC: 0000000","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the potential feedbacks that fauna can have on vegetation in the Arctic and the consequent controls of climate change impacts.</p> </div>","","","Canada; climate change; permafrost thaw; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; fauna; food web; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In remote regions, regular habitat assessments are logistically challenging and time consuming. Drones are increasingly being used by ecologists to conduct habitat assessments, but reliance on georeferenced data as ground truth may not always be feasible. We estimated goose habitat degradation using photointerpretation of drone imagery and compared estimates to those made with ground-based linear transects. In July 2016, we surveyed five study plots in La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, to evaluate the effectiveness of a fixed-wing drone with simple Red Green Blue (RGB) imagery for evaluating habitat degradation by snow geese. Ground-based land cover data was collected and grouped into barren, shrub, or non-shrub categories. We compared estimates between ground-based transects and those made from unsupervised classification of drone imagery collected at altitudes of 75, 100, and 120 m above ground level (ground sampling distances of 2.4, 3.2, and 3.8 cm respectively). We found large time savings during the data collection step of drone surveys, but these savings were ultimately lost during imagery processing. Based on photointerpretation, overall accuracy of drone imagery was generally high (88.8% to 92.0%) and Kappa coefficients were similar to previously published habitat assessments from drone imagery. Mixed model estimates indicated 75m drone imagery overestimated barren (F-2,F-182 = 100.03, P < 0.0001) and shrub classes (F-2,F-182 = 160.16, P < 0.0001) compared to ground estimates. Inconspicuous graminoid and forb species (non-shrubs) were difficult to detect from drone imagery and were underestimated compared to ground-based transects (F-2,F-182 = 843.77, P < 0.0001). Our findings corroborate previous findings, and that simple RGB imagery is useful for evaluating broad scale goose damage, and may play an important role in measuring habitat destruction by geese and other agents of environmental change.","2019-08-09","2025-02-24 15:11:05","2025-03-12 17:52:04","","","","8","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000485004000004","3.7","3","SC: 0000039","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper tss the use of drones to monitor vegetation change and the effects of herbivory in wetlands and peatlands in the Hudson bay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; other wetland; remote sensing; monitoring; unmanned aerial vehicle; vegetation disturbance; Hudson Bay Lowland; woody plants; graminoids; saltmarsh; marsh; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hyperabundant tundra-nesting geese are influencing Arctic environments through their foraging activities. Goose-induced habitat change in Arctic wetlands may influence the availability of habitat for numerous shorebird species that breed sympatrically with geese. We explore whether goose-induced habitat alteration affects shorebird breeding density and nest site selection. Using habitat data collected at sites with High, Moderate and Low goose influence, and samples collected during two periods separated by 11years, we document the habitat characteristics influenced by geese. We describe the habitat characteristics preferred by shorebirds and relate their availability to goose influence and shorebird density. Finally, we examine whether shorebird nest site selection has changed over time and whether shorebirds select nest sites differently in habitat influenced by geese. We document spatial and temporal changes in sedge meadow habitat and lateral concealment relating to goose influence. The availability of sedge meadow habitat and the degree of lateral concealment declined with increasing goose influence, and also declined at two sites over the 11years of the study. Densities of both cover- and open-nesting shorebirds were highest where goose influence was lowest. At sites with Low goose influence, cover-nesting shorebirds selected nest sites with more sedge meadow and concealment than at sites with Moderate and High goose influence, presumably because these high-quality sites were more available. Synthesis and applications. Intensive foraging by a colony of hyperabundant geese is limiting the availability of preferred nesting habitat and densities of sympatric-nesting shorebirds. Where goose-induced habitat alteration is pronounced shorebird species that select concealed nest sites are nesting in areas with lower concealment and less sedge meadow. Studies examining the degree to which these effects scale up to impact the population sizes of declining shorebirds should be considered a future research priority.

We assess the presence of introduced plant species and their persistence (since the previous survey) in a Canadian subpolar site on the Hudson Bay with a history of human introductions from large-scale grain inputs. Widespread sampling was done to locate all introduced plant species in the Churchill, MB, Canada area. We quantified edaphic variations through soil sampling, and the effect of aspect on introduced species' richness, cover, and height. At the regional scale, species life history traits and climate envelopes (average and variability of climate in a native range) were established to determine if persistent plant species had similar climate requirements. We found that despite statistically significant warming and increased precipitation, the number of introduced plant species in sub-Arctic Churchill declined from 80 to 36 between the 1989 and 2013 sampling periods. We found that introduced species favor locally warmer, human-disturbed sites with above average soil nutrients. The plant species that remained in Churchill since the 1989 survey compared to those that did not persist are better able to tolerate colder temperatures and have wider, more variable climate envelopes. The decline in introduced species is likely linked to changes in grain shipment inputs. Many of the introduced species recorded in 1989 may have only existed through constant seed subsidies from imports, suggesting that most species have not yet been successful in the absence of human modification. Although the number of introduced plants has decreased, we suggest that continuous disturbance is no longer required for some introduced species to persist suggesting that a climate threshold may have been crossed for some species. One introduced species (Taraxacum officinale, common dandelion) has spread to areas that have not been modified by humans and is now growing in two undisturbed locations. Its current distribution outside disturbed areas does not yet warrant the distinction of invasive at this time.

Exposed sediment, extent and type of vegetative cover, and aquatic areas were recorded along transects using a classification of 12 a priori classes. Five regions within the colony were identified, and changes in vegetation cover differed among these and depended on unique combinations of vegetation class and year. Grubbing by geese has led to loss of graminoid plants, especially in intertidal and supratidal marshes. Exposed sediments have largely replaced previously vegetated areas since 1976. Species characteristic of disturbed sites have colonized exposed sediment with the most abundant species varying according to soil conditions. In intertidal marshes, willow cover declined in association with the development of hypersalinity after loss of the graminoid mat, but willow cover increased at the base of well-drained beach ridges and in a river delta with ample winter snow accumulation and freshwater flow in spring that protected ground vegetation. Most of the expected successional trends associated with isostatic uplift and changes in soil organic matter failed to occur because of intense goose foraging throughout the 20 years. The likelihood of sustained recovery of plant communities in the immediate coastal zone is very low, as long as goose numbers continue to increase. Indirect effects of vegetation loss (e.g., hypersalinity) and subsequent erosion of exposed sediments following grubbing will delay plant colonization and retard succession.","2005-08","2025-02-24 15:11:05","2025-03-12 01:56:42","","269-275","","3","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000231886800001","2","4","SC: 0000059","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper follows the changes in vegetation and wetland area over 20 years as the result of lesser snow goose overgrazing in the Hudson ay Lowland.</p> </div>","","","Canada; vegetation; other wetland; monitoring; coastal ecosystem; vegetation sampling; migratory birds; fauna; vegetation disturbance; Hudson Bay Lowland; birds; saltmarsh; marsh; snow goose; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed the impact of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimm.) on peatland vegetation using an exclosure experiment. A total of 53 pairs of exclosures and unprotected plots were set up in bogs (13 pairs), sedge fens (20), shrub fens (7), and laggs (13), and surveyed prior to exclosure construction as well as three, five, and eight years after. Vascular plant composition of exclosures diverged from that of unprotected plots through time only in shrub fens and laggs. Bryophytes remained constant in all habitats. On average, shrub cover was 30% higher in exclosures in all habitats after five years, whereas herb cover increased only in laggs, by 43%, after eight years. Reclassification of sites by pH showed deer exclusion promoted alpha diversity in low-and high-moderate rich fens (pH 5.3-6.8) and beta diversity in the latter as well as in rich fens (pH 6.3-7.5).

Understanding the impact of disturbance on vegetation and the resilience of plant communities to disturbance is imperative to ecological theory and environmental management. In this study predictors of community resilience to a simulated natural disturbance are investigated. Responses to disturbance are examined at the community, plant functional type and species level. 2. Field experiments were set up in seven tundra plant communities, simulating disturbance based on the impact of grubbing by an increasing herbivore population of pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus). The short-term resilience of communities was assessed by comparing community dissimilarity between control plots and plots subject to three disturbance intensities based on the foraging impact of these geese. Potential for long-term recovery was evaluated across different disturbance patch sizes. 3. Resilience to disturbance varied between communities; those with higher moss cover and higher soil moisture, such as wetlands and mires, were most resilient to disturbance. 4. The wetter communities demonstrated greater long-term recovery potential following disturbance. In wetland communities, vegetative recovery of vascular plants and moss was greater in smaller disturbed patches and at the edges of patches. 5. The response of vegetation to disturbance varied with intensity of disturbance, plant community and plant species. The use of functional type classifications only partially explained the variation in species responses to disturbance across communities, thus their use in predicting community changes was limited. 6. Synthesis. The impact of disturbance is shown to be plant-community specific and related to the initial abiotic and biotic properties of the community. By showing that resilience is partly predictable, the identification of disturbance-susceptible communities is possible, which is of relevance for ecosystem management.","2010-09","2025-02-24 18:38:40","2025-03-12 12:54:52","","1002-1013","","5","98","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000280667200003","5.5","1","SC: 0000093","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of herbivory by pink-footed geese on peatlands in Scandinavia and demonstrate that moss-dominated wet communities are most resilient to goose herbivory.</p> </div>","","","peatland; bryophytes; migratory birds; fauna; birds; food web; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using weekly sampling throughout the growing season, we quantified the effects of muskox exclusion on aboveground plant biomass and on concentrations and pools of carbon and nitrogen, and explored the timing of peak biomass and nutrient pools. Excluding muskoxen profoundly changed plant abundances and dynamics of the fen, with more than a doubling of aboveground plant biomass and carbon and nitrogen pool sizes. Specifically, large increases in mosses and litter were observed, while graminoid biomass did not change significantly with exclusion of muskoxen. Excluding muskoxen advanced the peak of plant biomass, but also led to a more rapid decline, resulting in an earlier and shorter period of maximal plant biomass inside the exclosures. The largest impact of muskoxen on the arctic fen ecosystem seems to be through their trampling effects on the moss layer, which likely mediated most of the observed changes. This study demonstrates how quickly an ecosystem may respond to changes in the abundance of large herbivores and highlights their pivotal role in modifying vegetation dynamics and nutrient cycling in tundra ecosystems.","2019-08","2025-02-24 19:06:48","2025-03-12 12:52:37","","1095-1107","","5","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000480546800012","3.7","2","SC: 0000041","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of herbivory by muskoxen on vegetation and nutrient dynamics in a high arctic fen.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; vegetation; nutrients; substrate disturbance; bryophytes; compaction; fen; mammals; food web; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared plant community structure and S. lapponum abundance and traits between (1) grazed fens (Finland); (2) experimental exclosures (Finland), where reindeer have been kept out for 13 years; and (3) nongrazed fens (Norway). Grazing effect on shrubification was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and leaf area index (LAI). We did not find a uniform direction of vegetation change connected to the exclosure treatment, and grazing treatments were overlapping in multivariate ordination. Neither NDVI nor LAI indicated clear differences. Instead, significant results were revealed in total abundance of species groups and in S. lapponum traits. The cover of bryophytes was significantly lower under free grazing. Reindeer grazing reduced the abundance, height, and flowering and increased leaf N concentration of S. lapponum.

We used new, comprehensive survey data from a hillslope-scale field experiment initiated in 1954 to investigate the effects of burning and grazing treatments on Sphagnum. Historical data were consulted to aid interpretation of the results. The unburned reference and the most frequently burned (10-year rotation) treatments had greater Sphagnum abundance and hummock height than intermediate treatments (20-year rotation and no-burn since 1954). Abundance of the most common individual species (S. capillifolium, S. subnitens and S. papillosum) followed similar patterns. Light grazing had no impact on Sphagnum-related variables, nor did it interact with the burning treatments. These results suggest that in some cases fire has a negative impact on Sphagnum, and this can persist for several decades. However, fire return interval and other factors such as atmospheric pollution may alter effects, and in some cases Sphagnum abundance may recover. Fire severity and site specific conditions may also influence effects, so we advise consideration of these factors, and caution when using fire as a management tool on peatlands where Sphagnum is considered desirable.","2018-11-01","2025-02-24 19:06:48","2025-03-12 01:49:53","","","","11","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000449027600038","3.7","3","SC: 0000022","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the long-term effects of fire on Sphagnum in peatlands and points out to potential negative effects to sphagnum. </p> </div>","","","fire; vegetation; bryophytes; sphagnum; vegetation disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known about herbivory and its impact on the carbon balance in high arctic mire ecosystems. We hypothesized that trampling and grazing by large herbivores influences the vegetation density and composition and thereby also the carbon balance. In 2010, we established fenced exclosures in high arctic Greenland to prevent muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) from grazing. During the growing seasons of 2011 to 2013 we measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes in these ungrazed blocks and compared them to blocks subjected to natural grazing. Additionally, we measured depth of the water table and active layer, soil temperature, and in 2011 and 2013 an inventory of the vegetation density and composition were made. In 2013 a significant decrease in total number of vascular plant (33-44%) and Eriophorum scheuchzeri (51-53%) tillers were found in ungrazed plots, the moss-layer and amount of litter had also increased substantially in these plots. This resulted in a significant decrease in net ecosystem uptake of CO2 (47%) and likewise a decrease in CH4 emission (44%) in ungrazed plots in 2013. While the future of the muskoxen in a changing arctic is unknown, this experiment points to a potentially large effect of large herbivores on the carbon balance in natural Arctic ecosystems. It thus sheds light on the importance of grazing mammals, and hence adds to our understanding of natural ecosystem greenhouse gas balance in the past and in the future.","2015-04","2025-02-24 19:06:48","2025-03-12 01:49:53","","","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000353641400022","6.7","2","SC: 0000091","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of muskoxen herbivores on food webs and greenhouse gas relations in a high arctic peatland.</p> </div>","","","climate change; vegetation; vascular plants; greenhouse gases; carbon cycle; fauna; mammals; vegetation disturbance; graminoids; food web; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the significance of mosses in Arctic wetlands is well recognized, the long-term influence of medium-sized herbivores on the composition of moss communities has received limited attention. We used data from a long-term (25years) Greater Snow Goose (Anser caerulescens atlanticus) exclusion experiment in Arctic tundra wetlands to assess changes in the composition of moss communities at multiple spatial scales (cell, 4cm2; quadrat, 100cm2; exclosure, 16m2). We investigated how snow goose grazing and grubbing can alter the composition of the moss community by measuring changes in alpha and beta diversity, as well as in the strength of plant interspecific interactions between moss species. Our results indicate that goose foraging significantly increased species diversity (richness, evenness, and inverse Simpson index) of moss communities at the cell and quadrat scales but not the exclosure scale. Goose foraging reduced the dissimilarity (beta diversity) of moss communities at all three scales, mainly due to decreased species turnover. Furthermore, goose foraging increased positive interaction between moss species pairs. These findings emphasize the critical role of geese in promoting moss species coexistence and increasing homogeneity in Arctic wetlands. This study illustrates how top-down regulation by herbivores can alter plant communities in Arctic wetlands and highlights the importance of considering herbivores when examining the response of Arctic plant biodiversity to future climate change.","2024-04","2025-02-24 19:24:04","2025-10-02 14:20:57","2024-04-27","e11272-e11272","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","MEDLINE:38665892","2.6","2","SC: 0000000","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of long-term herbivory by geese on the bryophyte flora in high arctic peatlands. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; vegetation; bryophytes; fen; migratory birds; fauna; birds; snow goose; brown mosses; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the exploitation ecosystem hypothesis of Oksanen et al. (1981), food chains are controlled by top-down interactions. However, because the arctic primary productivity is low, herbivore populations are too small to support functional predator populations and these communities should thus be dominated by the plant/ herbivore trophic-level interaction. Since 1990, we have been monitoring annual abundance and productivity of geese, the impact of goose grazing, predator abundance (mostly arctic foxes, Alopex lagopus) and the abundance of lemmings, the other significant herbivore in this community, on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada. Goose grazing consistently removed a significant proportion of the standing crop (∼40%) in tundra wetlands every year. Grazing changed plant community composition and reduced the production of grasses and sedges to a low-level equilibrium compared to the situation where the presence of geese had been removed. Lemming cyclic fluctuations were strong and affected fox reproduction. Fox predation on goose eggs was severe and generated marked annual variation in goose productivity.

The measured benthic fluxes for the two greenhouse gases were found to be either higher or similar to those determined at the water-air interface during the ice-free sampling periods. For the 2 year duration of the study, emission fluxes of CH4 to the atmosphere generally varied between 5 and 10 mg m?2 d?1, while those for CO2 ranged from 500 to 1100 mg m?2 d?1. Furthermore, through the use of static chambers at the water-air interface, we determined that the emission fluxes for the gases are controlled by molecular diffusion. Our calculated fluxes have been separated into two groups: (1) regular emission fluxes and (2) above-average emission fluxes. The first type comprises the majority of fluxes measured during the sampling periods (i.e., 88% for CH4 and 87% for CO2). The second group reflects unusual sampling conditions (e.g., strong winds, water column depths of less than 1 m, or flooded peatland mats floating at the surface). Although data for this group are limited, our preliminary results suggest that they may be an important component in an atmospheric emissions budget for large reservoirs. Concentration profiles for CH4 and CO2 dissolved in the water column clearly show that oxidation and/or horizontal advection of these gases are controlling factors in their subsequent release to the atmosphere. Most of the CH4 is oxidized within the first 25 cm above the flooded soil-water interface. Consequently, neither benthic emissions of CH4 and CO2 nor the type of flooded soil appear to control atmospheric emissions of these gases from hydroelectric reservoirs.","1995-12-01","2025-02-25 18:52:40","2025-03-07 18:06:15","2025-02-25","529-540","","4","9","","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.2","1","SC: 0000024  Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the impact of flooding from hydroelectrical dams in the James Bay region (QC) on greenhouse gas emissions from flooded peatlands and forest soils. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; greenhouse gases; flooding; carbon cycle; power generation; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New findings challenge the notion of hydroelectric development as a benign alternative to other forms of power generation. This review examines the intertwined environmental and social effects of methylmercury bioaccumulation in the food web, emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs, downstream effects of altered flows, and impacts on biodiversity, each of which operates at its own unique spatial and temporal scales. Methylmercury bioaccumulation occurs at the smallest spatial and temporal scales of the four impacts reviewed, whereas downstream effects usually occur at the largest scales. Greenhouse gas emissions, the newest surprise connected with large-scale hydroelectric development, are relatively short term but eventually may have important global-scale consequences. Limitation of biodiversity by hydroelectric development usually occurs at intermediate spatial and temporal scales. Knowledge developed from working at expanded spatial and temporal scales should be an important part of future decision making for large-scale hydroelectric development.","1997-03-01","2025-02-25 18:54:51","2025-03-07 18:06:16","2025-02-25","27-54","","1","5","","Environ.

Remote sensing offers detailed insights into critical peatland features, including the classification of peatland vegetation, assessment of water table dynamics, mapping of vegetation condition and diversity and the estimation of carbon stocks. Furthermore, the review delineates the utility of remote sensing in monitoring the recovery processes of restored peatlands, highlighting the scarcity of long-term studies. It also emphasizes the potential of integrating hyperspectral, multispectral and SAR data as well as cross-scale analyses.

In this article, we provide a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative to peatland health monitoring through the implementation of low-cost hyperspectral imaging techniques. Using common peatland plant species as a proxy for underlying peat health, we monitor the spectral response of Sphagnum plants under varying degrees of water stress to document their spectral response under these conditions.

However, inevitably this dependence on fossil fuels has resulted in  serious environmental issues over recent decades. The eco-toxicity and the  potential health implications that petroleum hydrocarbons pose for both  environmental and human health have led to increased interest in developing  environmental biotechnology-based methodologies to detoxify environments impacted  by petrogenic compounds. Different approaches have been applied for remediating  polluted sites with petroleum derivatives. Bioremediation represents an  environmentally sustainable and economical emerging technology for maximizing the  metabolism of organic pollutants and minimizing the ecological effects of oil  spills. Bioremediation relies on microbial metabolic activities in the presence  of optimal ecological factors and necessary nutrients to transform organic  pollutants such as petrogenic hydrocarbons. Although, biodegradation often takes  longer than traditional remediation methods, the complete degradation of the  contaminant is often accomplished. Hydrocarbon biodegradation in soil is  determined by a number of environmental and biological factors varying from site  to site such as the pH of the soil, temperature, oxygen availability and nutrient  content, the growth and survival of hydrocarbon-degrading microbes and  bioavailability of pollutants to microbial attack. In this review we have  attempted to broaden the perspectives of scientists working in bioremediation.

Bioremediation is often preferred as clean and carbon-neutral solution.  This review aims to provide series of sustainable solution for petroleum  hydrocarbon degradation without exploiting the environment as well as opportunity  to reuse treated media. Integrated and enhanced bioremediation technologies are  more effective than natural degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in terms of  shorter time period and percent removal efficiency. It comprehensively  illustrates bioremediation assisted with bacteria, fungi, and algae either by  integrated technologies or by enhancing the process.

It is a magmatic sulfide deposit hosted by mafic and ultramafic rocks interpreted to be a feeder conduit beneath an extensive complex of sills and related volcanic rocks, which range in composition from dunite through ferrogabbro to rhyolite. The complex, called the Ring of Fire, has been dated at 2734.5 ± 1.0 Ma and it was emplaced into 2773.37 ± 0.9 Ma felsic plutonic rocks. The felsic rocks form a sill complex structurally beneath metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks considered to have formed along a passive margin at ca. 2800 Ma within the Oxford-Stull domain of the North Caribou superterrane in the Archean Superior province. In its original configuration, the Eagle’s Nest deposit formed in a shallowly plunging or subhorizontal keel structure at the base of a dike-like chonolith, but subsequent deformation has turned it into a vertically plunging rod of sulfide mineralization along the northwestern margin of a north-south–striking dike. The most magnesian chilled margin is a picrite with MgO content near 18 wt percent, placing it at the boundary between komatiite sensu stricto and komatiitic basalt. Modeling suggests that the parental magma contained at least 22 percent MgO and was derived from previously melt depleted mantle. Sulfide saturation was attained following extensive contamination of the magma, resulting in the accumulation of a slurry of olivine crystals with variable amounts of interstitial sulfide melt and postcumulus orthopyroxene at the base of the conduit, locally producing significant pools of massive sulfide at or near the lower contact. The sulfide segregation occurred at moderate degrees of sulfide supersaturation from a magma rich in chalcophile elements, leading to high base and precious metal tenors in the resulting deposit. Minor fractionation of the sulfide magma is evidenced by the dispersion of massive and net-textured sulfide compositions along a tie-line between Ni-rich monosulfide and Cu-rich intermediate sulfide solid solutions, as well as by minor quantities of vein-hosted massive sulfide with extremely enriched base and precious metal tenors throughout the deposit. The former are interpreted as sulfide cumulates, whereas the latter are possible remnants of highly evolved sulfide liquids. Extensive metamorphic remobilization of Pt is considered to be responsible for wholesale depletion of Pt in much of the massive sulfide and for the local generation of sulfide veins carrying >1,100 ppm Pt.","2010","2025-03-05 15:40:48","2025-03-12 12:53:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","Society of Economic Geologists","","","","","","","","","SC: 0000065","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents the geology of the Eagle’s Nest deposit in the Ring of Fire, including descriptions of the massive sulphide deposits.</p> </div>","","","Ontario; biogeochemistry; mining; Ring-of-Fire; copper; mineral exploration; metal/metalloid; nickel; Hudson Bay Lowland; sulphur compounds; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the application of CW for wastewater treatment in frigid climate presents special challenges. Wetland treatment of wastewater relies largely on biological processes, and reliable treatment is often a function of climate conditions. To date, the rate of adoption of wetland technology for wastewater treatment in cold regions has been slow and there are relatively few published reports on CW applications in cold climate. This paper therefore highlights the practice and applications of treatment wetlands in cold climate. A comprehensive review of the effectiveness of contaminant removal in different wetland systems including: (1) free water surface (FWS) CWs; (2) subsurface flow (SSF) CWs; and (3) hybrid wetland systems, is presented. The emphasis of this review is also placed on the influence of cold weather conditions on the removal efficacies of different contaminants. The strategies of wetland design and operation for performance intensification, such as the presence of plant, operational mode, effluent recirculation, artificial aeration and in-series design, which are crucial to achieve the sustainable treatment performance in cold climate, are also discussed. This study is conducive to further research for the understanding of CW design and treatment performance in cold climate.","2017-07","2025-03-05 18:25:57","2025-03-12 12:55:07","","293-311","","","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6.9","2","SC: 0000286","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the cold climate design consideration for treatment wetlands for treating municipal wastewaters.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; other wetland; nutrients; impact minimization; nutrient enrichment; treatment wetland; mitigation hierarchy; wastewater; cold climate; climate; remediation; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the last 25 years, projects have been conducted in these regions to re-establish vegetation and facilitate recolonization by wildlife. We tested whether vegetation structure and bird species assemblages 10 to 20 years post extraction differ among natural, unrestored and restored bogs at the scales of individual sites and entire bogs. We conducted bird counts and vegetation surveys between 1993 and 2019, using both point counts (309 sites) and Autonomous Recording Units (80 sites). According to our vegetation surveys, restoration of sites that were previously used for peat harvesting accelerated the establishment of Sphagnum and herbaceous strata, but ericaceous and tree strata were unaffected over a 17-year period. None of the bird species with large home ranges were associated specifically to natural, unrestored, or restored areas at the bog level. Bird species diversity was similar in restored and natural sites, but lower in unrestored sites. Alder Flycatcher and American Goldfinch occupied restored and unrestored sites more frequently than natural sites, independent of the number of years post extraction. Occupancy of restored sites by Palm and Yellow-rumped Warblers increased over the years, reaching levels similar to those in natural sites 20 years after restoration was implemented. Occupancy of restored sites by Song and Savannah sparrows increased from 1993-2019 and diverged from their declining occupancy of natural sites. Species assemblages of restored and unrestored sites differed significantly from those of natural sites soon after peat extraction ceased or post restoration. But assemblages from restored and unrestored sites became progressively similar to those of natural sites during the first 20 years, especially in restored sites. We conclude that bird species assemblages of restored bog sites are converging toward those of natural sites, and that restoration provides novel habitats for regionally declining species, e.g., Savannah Sparrows.","2021-01-01","2025-03-10 17:19:27","2025-03-12 12:54:45","","2021.11.26.470119","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SC: 0000003","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper looks at the long-term recolonization of birds following the restoration of peatlands after peat extraction.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; bog; substrate disturbance; migratory birds; mitigation hierarchy; fauna; vegetation disturbance; birds; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wetland buffer zones (WBZs) are wetland ecosystems between agricultural lands and water bodies that protect surface waters from non-point source pollution. We assessed how vegetation harvesting within WBZs impacts their N and P removal efficiency, nutrient uptake by plants and their biomass quality. We surveyed vegetation of a spontaneously rewetted fen along a small river in Poland, and analysed plant biomass, its nutrient contents and nutrient-leaching potential and the water chemistry. Total N removal reached 34–92% and total P removal 17–63%. N removal was positively related to the initial N concentration, regardless of mowing status. We found a high N removal efficiency (92%) in the harvested site. Vegetation of mown sites differed from that of unmown sites by a higher water-leached carbon and P contents in the biomass. We found that vegetation harvesting may stimulate the overall N removal, but may increase potential biomass decomposability, which eases the recycling of plant-incorporated nutrients back to WBZ. Thus, mowing should always be followed by the removal of biomass. Neglecting already mown WBZs may temporarily lower their nutrient removal efficiency due to potentially faster decomposition of plant biomass.","2021-08-01","2025-03-10 17:29:24","2025-03-12 12:54:48","","","","","848","","Hydrobiologia","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.6","3","SC: 0000031","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper shows that mowing and removal of cut biomass can reduce nutrient enrichment in riverine fens in Europe.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; on-site restoration; nutrients; nutrient enrichment; fen; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In temperate fens, peat is mainly formed by below‐ground biomass of vascular plants. Nutrient availability in temperate fens is naturally variable, and nowadays increasing due to atmospheric deposition, runoff from agriculture and mineralization of peat caused by drainage. To maintain or restore peat formation, it is important to understand how increased nutrient availability influences the main controls of peat formation, that is, below‐ground biomass production and decomposition. We investigated above‐ and below‐ground biomass production and decomposition of five fen sedges (Carex spp.) grown under 12 different nutrient levels (realized with nitrogen amounts increasing exponentially across levels, with addition of phosphorous and potassium to ensure nitrogen limitation in each nutrient level) in a mesocosm experiment, designed to resemble a gradient of very low to very high nutrient availabilities in temperate fens. In addition, we measured nutrient stoichiometry in the biomass and related this to possible growth limitations and to root decomposition. Our results indicate that higher biomass production at higher nutrient levels was not offset by an increase in decomposition. Increase of above‐ and below‐ground biomass with higher nutrient levels was species‐specific. Decomposition of standardized plant material in mesocosms was not dependent on the species growing in the mesocosms and showed only slight, if any, variation with differing nutrient levels. Decomposition of roots grown under different nutrient levels was mainly correlated with species identity and root lignin:cellulose ratio. Our study suggests that the Carex spp. potentially peat‐forming root biomass, here defined as the root biomass which is not decomposed during one growing season, increases with increasing nutrient levels: higher root biomass production is not counteracted by increasing decomposition during the growing season. Based on this pattern of positive mass balance in five common sedge species with differing growth characteristics, we propose that sedge communities establishing after rewetting have the potential for renewed peat formation regardless of the prevailing trophic level.

Rewetting has been proposed as a measure to restore peatland functioning and to halt carbon loss, but its effectiveness is subject to debate. An important prerequisite for peatland recovery is a return of typical microbial communities, which drive key processes. To evaluate the effect of rewetting, we investigated 13 fen peatland areas across a wide (>1500 km) longitudinal gradient in Europe, in which we compared microbial communities between drained, undrained, and rewetted sites. There was a clear difference in microbial communities between drained and undrained fens, regardless of location. Community recovery upon rewetting was substantial in the majority of sites, and predictive functional profiling suggested a concomitant recovery of biogeochemical peatland functioning. However, communities in rewetted sites were only similar to those of undrained sites when soil organic matter quality (as expressed by cellulose fractions) and quantity were still sufficiently high. We estimate that a minimum organic matter content of ca. 70% is required to enable microbial recovery. We conclude that peatland recovery after rewetting is conditional on the level of drainage-induced degradation: severely altered physicochemical peat properties may preclude complete recovery for decades.","2020-04-03","2025-03-10 17:30:34","2025-03-17 19:24:54","","","","","14","","The ISME Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","11","1","SC: 0000065","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper documents the changes in microbial activity and communities following the rewetting of drained fens in Europe. </p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; on-site restoration; microbial activity; drawdown; rewetting; fen; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We re-analysed the long-term outcomes of restoration on vegetation and plant functional traits in 38 European fens restored by rewetting (18 sites) and topsoil removal (20 sites). We used traits related to nutrient acquisition strategies, competitiveness, seed traits, and used single- and multi-trait metrics. A separate set of vegetation records from near-natural fens with diverse plant communities was used to generate reference values to aid the comparisons. We found that both restoration methods enhanced the similarity of species composition to non-degraded systems but trait analysis revealed differences between the two approaches. Traits linked to nutrient acquisition strategies indicated that topsoil removal was more effective than rewetting. After topsoil removal competitive species in plant communities had decreased, while stress-tolerant species had increased. A substantial reduction in nutrient availability ruled out the effect of initial disturbance. An ability to survive and grow in anoxic conditions was enhanced after restoration, but the reference values were not achieved. Rewetting was more effective than topsoil removal in restricting variation in traits values permitted in re-developing vegetation. We found no indication of a shift towards reference in seed traits, which suggested that dispersal constraint and colonization deficit can be a widespread phenomena. Two functional diversity indices: functional richness and functional dispersion showed response to restoration and shifted values towards reference mires and away from the degraded systems. We concluded that targeting only one type of environmental stressor does not lead to a recovery of fens, as it provides insufficient level of stress to restore a functional ecosystem. In general, restoration efforts do not ensure the re-establishment and long-term persistence of fens. Restoration efforts result in recovery of fen ecosystems, confirmed with our functional trait analysis, although more rigid actions are needed for restoring fully functional mires, by achieving high and constant levels of anoxia and nutrient stresses.","2019-04-24","2025-03-10 17:31:24","2025-03-12 12:52:37","","e0215645","","","14","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.7","3","SC: 0000019","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper focuses on functional plant types to demonstrate that rewetting or nutrient removal can restore fen ecosystems.</p> </div>","","","on-site restoration; vegetation; drawdown; rewetting; nutrient enrichment; mitigation hierarchy; functional types; hydrological management; fertility change/contamination; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assessment of success can vary considerably, depending on the identified criteria, be it bird diversity, rare plants, peat formation or nutrient status. Some authors distinguish restoration of fens (i.e. returning damaged fens near to the pre-disturbance state) from mire rehabilitation (i.e. re-establishment of their selected functions, which may result in systems that have not existed at the restoration site in the past), whereas others focus on restoring key ecosystem functions of fens, such as peat formation and role in carbon cycling, formulating long-term targets. In this chapter we attempt to structure the discussion around fen restoration by identifying challenges and trade-offs in this field and to clarify how close these different concepts come to the objective of reinstalling or improving the provision of key ecosystem services. We focus on lowland fens in West and Central Europe (UK, The Netherlands, Germany, Poland). We will first discuss the concept of fen ecosystems, their ‘naturalness’, resilience and stability, and the ecosystem services they provide. Next, we introduce the main ecological gradients in fens, the drivers of fen degradation and the consequences for ecosystem services, followed by an overview of constraints, synergies and conflicting targets in fen restoration. We conclude with an overview of gains and trade-offs of various restoration strategies.","2016-06-01","2025-03-10 17:32:01","2025-03-12 12:52:27","","170-191","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SC: 0000026  Journal Abbreviation: Peatland Restoration and Ecosystem Services: Science, Policy and Practice DOI: 10.1017/CBO9781139177788.011","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the problem and approaches of restoring fen peatlands in Europe. </p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; nutrients; rewetting; nutrient enrichment; fen; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological management; fertility change/contamination; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine whether removal of shrubs enhances recovery of target species in a degraded fen subjected to moderate rewetting. The study was located in the drained fen Całowanie (central Poland), where remnants of open fen communities and willow-invaded fens exist in former turf-pits, surrounded by degraded meadows on dried peat. All these three habitat types were included in a monitoring grid, which covered an area of 2.2 ha. Within 55 quadrats of 20 m × 20 m we monitored occurrence of 52 species, i.e. two groups of target species (fen indicators and wet meadow indicators) and indicators of two failure scenarios (degraded fen indicators and eutrophic wetland indicators), during six years following shrub removal, rewetting and re-application of conservational mowing, using a 3-step ordinal abundance scale. NMDS ordination revealed a gradual convergence of shrub removal plots and reference plots. We noticed significant effects of year and habitat type on all indicator groups, but only fen indicators have shown a clear (increasing) trend within shrub removal plots. Degraded fen indicators (ruderal and opportunistic species) initially expanded on shrub removal plots, but this effect disappeared in the following years. We conclude that shrub removal enhances establishment of target species in a moderately drained and then rewetted fen and attribute this effect to lowered competition for light. However, given high costs of this method and long-lasting problems with shrub resprouts, we recommend applying shrub removal only to recently overgrown sites, which still retained high botanical diversity. Heavily degraded fen meadows did not react on the increase of moisture, which indicates that more advanced restoration measures, such as top soil removal are needed there.","2013-03-15","2025-03-10 17:33:13","2025-03-12 12:54:51","","294-308","","","21","","Journal for Nature Conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","3","SC: 0000017","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that shrub removal from rewetted fens helps restore them back to fen ecosystems. </p> </div>","","","peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; drawdown; rewetting; fen; woody plants; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two measures commonly suggested for restoring drained fens is ditch blocking and tree removal to raise the groundwater table and increase light availability, respectively. In 2002, we initiated factorial restoration experiments, including ditch blocking and tree removal, in three former rich fens that had been drained for forestry purposes. Species cover of vascular plants and bryophytes were monitored during 8 years in permanent plots along transects perpendicular to the ditch for all four treatment combinations. Both methods had positive and independent effects on the cover of wetland vegetation. Specifically, Sphagnum species and wetland bryophytes showed a persistent positive response to both clear cutting and rewetting. Wetland vascular plants and grasses showed a persistent positive response to clear cutting. Sedges and species number responded positively to both clear cutting and ditch blocking, but the response was partly transient, and for species richness the response was limited when restoration methods were applied separately. Rich fen indicators of vascular plants and bryophytes did not respond to any of the restoration treatments. This indicates that species introduction in combination with further habitat restorations may be necessary to re-establish the original rich fen flora. Nevertheless, we conclude that the combination of ditch blocking and clear cutting are effective measures to partly restore wetland vegetation on previously drained and forested fens, while peat subsidence along the ditch may restrict the success further away from ditches.","2012-03-01","2025-03-10 17:34:27","2025-10-02 14:12:54","","60–67","","","147","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.9","1","SC: 0000090","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This study presents an experiment to determined the extent to which rewetting can restore rich fens. rewettting improves hydrological conditions, but not fully restore fen vegetation. </p> </div>","","","on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; water table; drawdown; rewetting; bryophytes; sphagnum; fen; forest harvest; mitigation hierarchy; agriculture; graminoids; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; brown mosses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increases in anthropogenic noise are altering the ways animals communicate. A common adaptation shown by bird species to anthropogenic noise is song frequency shifts, but birds may also adapt their ability to communicate in noisy environments in other ways. We compared the vocal features of Lincoln's Sparrow Melospiza lincolnii breeding in noisy areas (compressor stations) and in quiet areas in Northern Alberta, Canada. We hypothesized that Lincoln's Sparrow could (1) shift its songs to avoid masking, resulting in higher-frequency songs, and/or (2) change song allocation (singing rate, number of songs), resulting in improved song transmission. Additionally, we tested the effect of distance and height on song transmission close to a noisy compressor station and in a quiet area to determine if behavioural adaptations might allow more effective song transmission. We did not find frequency shifts between quiet and noisy areas. However, we found birds singing at higher song rates in noisy areas, supporting the song allocation hypothesis. Interestingly, the number of song types sung in noisy sites was fewer than in quiet areas. Distance influenced song transmission differently in noisy and quiet areas, as the signal to noise ratio was substantially less at 20 m in noisy areas than in the control. A higher singing rate may therefore compensate for reduced song transmission by increasing the likelihood of being heard by conspecifics in noisy areas. We found evidence of song adaptation by Lincoln's Sparrow to deal with anthropogenic noise, but whether it is sufficient to facilitate long-distance communication used to attract females and in male-male interactions remains unknown.","2023-07","2025-03-10 17:39:59","2025-03-12 20:05:49","","944-958","","3","165","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000904042500001","2.1","3","SC: 0000004","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that Lincoln sparrows, a mostly peatland species, must increase their signing rate to overcome chronic noise pollution.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; mining; mineral processing; migratory birds; fauna; birds; other stressors; noise pollution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, indirect effects of global change, such as the variation in soil nutrient availability and grazing pressure, can alter soil and surface properties of the Arctic tundra, with the potential to modify soil heat transfers toward the permafrost and impact resilience of Arctic ecosystems. We determined the potential of nutrient availability and grazing to alter soil energy balance using a 16-year split-plot experiment crossing fertilization at different doses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) with protection from goose grazing. Moss biomass and some determinants of the surface energy budget (leaf area index (LAI), dead vascular plant biomass and albedo) were quantified and active layer thaw depth repeatedly measured during three growing seasons. We measured soil physical properties and thermal conductivity and used a physical model to link topsoil organic accumulation processes to heat transfer. Fertilization increased LAI and albedo, whereas grazing decreased dead vascular plant biomass and albedo. Fertilization increased organic accumulation at the top of the soil leading to drier and more porous topsoil, whereas grazing increased water content of topsoil. As a result, topsoil thermal conductivity was higher in grazed plots than in ungrazed ones. Including these properties into a simulation model, we showed that, after 16 years, nutrient addition tended to shallow the active layer whereas grazing deepened mean July active layer by 3.3 cm relative to ungrazed subplots. As a result of OM accumulation at the surface, fertilization increased permafrost vertical aggradation rate by almost an order of magnitude (up to 5 mm year(-1) instead of 0.7 mm year(-1)), whereas grazing slowed down permafrost aggradation by reducing surface uprising and deepening thaw depth. Synthesis. We demonstrated that long-term grazing and N and P addition, through their impact on vegetation and soil properties have the potential to impact permafrost dynamics to the same extent as contemporary temperature increase in High Arctic polygonal wetlands.","2023-02","2025-03-10 17:39:59","2025-03-12 12:55:06","","449-463","","2","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000891909600001","5.5","1","SC: 0000009","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines how nutrient enrichment and overgrazing by greater snow geese controls the permafrost in high Arctic peatlands. </p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; nutrients; nutrient enrichment; cold climate; climate; fertility change/contamination; snow goose; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Few studies have simultaneously examined the response of plant communities to these two pressures over a long period. This study aims to assess which driver between increasing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability through global warming and increasing N availability alone via N deposition is more likely to transform arctic wetland vegetation and whether there is a time lag in this response. An annual fertilization experiment simulating these nutrient inputs was conducted for 17 years in the Canadian High-Arctic to assess the impact on aboveground net primary productivity, floristic composition, and plant nutrient concentration. While the primary productivity of mosses remains unchanged by fertilization after 17 years, productivity of graminoids was increased slightly by N addition (36% increase at the highest dose). In contrast, the primary productivity of graminoids increased strongly with N/P addition (over 227% increase). We noted no difference in graminoid productivity between the 2nd and 5th year of the experiment, but we observed a 203% increase between the 5th and 17th year in the N/P addition treatments. We also noted a 49% decrease in the total moss cover and an 155% increase in the total graminoid cover between the 2nd and 17th year of N/P addition. These results indicate that the impact of warming through increased N/P availability was greater than those of N deposition alone (N addition) and promoted the transition from a moss-dominated tundra to a graminoid-dominated tundra. However, this transition was subject to a time lag of up to 17 years, suggesting that increased productivity of graminoids resulted from a release of nutrients via the decomposition of lower parts of the moss mat.","2022-05","2025-03-10 17:39:59","2025-10-02 13:58:41","","","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000801406900001","2.9","4","SC: 0000007","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of nutrient additions, either N or N+P, on the productivity and vegetation community in Arctic peatlands with no herbivory.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; nutrients; carbon cycle; primary productivity; bryophytes; nutrient enrichment; fen; cold climate; graminoids; fertility change/contamination; brown mosses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, most studies of noise and wildlife come from traffic noise in cities. Less is known about the effects of noise created by industry in natural areas. Songbirds far from cities, but influenced by industry, could be affected by noise, but also are likely to be impacted by changes in vegetation conditions related to industrial development. We described the importance of industrial noise (from facilities and transportation) on occupancy of Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza lincolnii) relative to habitat change caused by vegetation alteration and edge effects. Lincoln's Sparrows naturally breed in varying seral stages and types of boreal forest. To test the influence of industrial noise, we selected three areas in Northern Alberta, Canada with high, medium, and low levels of industrial development and varying road density. At each area, we deployed a systematic arrangement of autonomous recording units (280 units in total, separated by 600 m) for 3 consecutive days. To measure noise, we developed a method that used the relative noise values extracted from the recordings of 8 frequency-octave bands. We obtained three noise measurements: noise with high energy in the low part of the spectrum (mean 0.5-1 kHz), masking level noise (mean 2-8 kHz), and noise in all frequency octave bands (mean 0.5-16 kHz). Proportion of chronic noise sources explained the highest variation of noise in the environment, and less by traffic noise. We found Lincoln's Sparrow had a higher occupancy in areas with higher proportion of industrial disturbances, shrubs and grass, and decreased in noisy areas. Masking level noise had a negative effect on Lincoln's Sparrow occupancy in areas with industrial disturbances, relative to areas with similar changes in vegetation structure, but no noise. Masking noise could indicate limitation in communication as noise increases. Our study amplifies the findings of others that future research should consider not only anthropogenic changes to vegetation in human-altered landscapes, but also human-caused changes to acoustic environments.","2022-03-29","2025-03-10 17:39:59","2025-03-12 20:06:04","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000783800800001","3","2","SC: 0000005","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper shows how chronic noise near Alberta oil sands operations reduces the habitat use by Lincoln’s sparrow.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; vegetation; mining; mineral processing; migratory birds; fauna; birds; other stressors; noise pollution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the Arctic, behavior and abundance of geese have changed due to climate and land-use change. While the short-term effects of increased goose populations on tundra ecosystems are known, there is a knowledge gap for long-term consequences of goose population changes on nutrient cycling and plant communities, especially in the High-Arctic. Here, we compared wetland sites where geese have been almost absent for at least 50 years (Pond Inlet), and nearby sites where geese are abundant or sites where they have been excluded experimentally by cages and where the ground has been experimentally fertilized for over 16 years (Bylot Island). Long-term goose disappearance increased inorganic nutrients in wetlands through increased plant litter decomposition and changed community composition, likely by altering competitive relationships between three dominant vascular plant species that are different in terms of nutrient acquisition and use. In experimentally fertilized sites, inorganic nutrients were similarly increased, but fertilization had contrast effects on plant community composition compared with herbivory, released plant species from the nutrient limitation and converted wetland habitats to a dryer state. Overall, our results suggest that the direct effects of goose herbivory on vegetation are more profound than their indirect effects through an alternation of nutrient cycling even in nutrient-limited wetlands of the Arctic. These findings emphasize the need to assess long-term direct impacts of herbivores on vegetation.","2021-03","2025-03-10 17:39:59","2025-03-12 12:55:06","","","","","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000649685200002","1.8","4","SC: 0000012","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper looks at the effects of nutrient enrichment versus overgrazing by greater snow geese on the vegetation of peatlands in the high Arctic.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; vegetation; vascular plants; nutrients; nutrient enrichment; migratory birds; cold climate; fauna; graminoids; climate; fertility change/contamination; snow goose; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ongoing permafrost thaw is transforming these peatlands, causing abrupt changes to their morphology, hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry. In this review we show how changes to individual peatlands depend on both their Holocene developmental history and their location within current permafrost zones. Permafrost thaw in peatlands often leads to land surface collapse between 0.5 and 5 m, the so-called thermokarst. Thermokarst in peatlands can lead to the development of ice-wedge troughs, waterlogged thermokarst bogs and fens, and the initiation, expansion, and drainage of thermokarst lakes. Permafrost thaw in peatlands can thus completely alter vegetation composition and shift patterns of landscape inundation and hydrological connectivity. These changes in turn have implications for magnitude and timing of runoff, downstream water quality, habitat suitability for birds and larger mammals, traditional land-use, and the exchange of greenhouse gases with the atmosphere. Ongoing permafrost thaw is largely irreversible at relevant human time-scales, and peatland thermokarst has been accelerating over the last few decades. Complete permafrost loss is expected this century for peatlands in relatively warmer permafrost zones, and all peatlands in the northern permafrost region will be profoundly transformed by permafrost thaw.","2021","2025-03-10 17:39:59","2025-03-12 12:52:51","","27-67","","","241","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000743588800004","","","SC: 0000035  DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-71330-0_3","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the multiple effects of climate-induced permafrost thaw on the ecology and vegetation of northern peatlands.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; climate change; hydrology; peatland; permafrost; permafrost thaw; vegetation; greenhouse gases; substrate disturbance; water quality; carbon cycle; surface water/runoff; cold climate; climate; hydrological alteration","","Jackson, RB; Canadell, JG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we used machine-learning techniques with extensive peat core data (n > 7,000) to create observation-based maps of northern peatland C and N stocks, and to assess their response to warming and permafrost thaw. We estimate that northern peatlands cover 3.7 +/- 0.5 million km(2) and store 415 +/- 150 Pg C and 10 +/- 7 Pg N. Nearly half of the peatland area and peat C stocks are permafrost affected. Using modeled global warming stabilization scenarios (from 1.5 to 6 degrees C warming), we project that the current sink of atmospheric C (0.10 +/- 0.02 Pg C.y(-1)) in northern peatlands will shift to a C source as 0.8 to 1.9 million km 2 of permafrost-affected peatlands thaw. The projected thaw would cause peatland greenhouse gas emissions equal to similar to 1% of anthropogenic radiative forcing in this century. The main forcing is from methane emissions (0.7 to 3 Pg cumulative CH4-C) with smaller carbon dioxide forcing (1 to 2 Pg CO2-C) and minor nitrous oxide losses. We project that initial CO2-C losses reverse after similar to 200 y, as warming strengthens peatland C-sinks. We project substantial, but highly uncertain, additional losses of peat into fluvial systems of 10 to 30 Pg C and 0.4 to 0.9 Pg N.

Recent warming is accelerating peatland permafrost thaw and thermokarst collapse, exposing previously frozen peat to microbial decomposition and potential mineralization into greenhouse gases. Here, we show from a site in the sporadic-discontinuous permafrost zone of western Canada that thermokarst collapse leads to neither large losses nor gains following thaw, as deep carbon losses are offset by surficial accumulation. We collected peat cores along two thaw chronosequences, from peat plateau, through young (30 years since thaw), intermediate (70 years), and mature (200 years) thermokarst bog locations. Macrofossil and C-14 analysis showed synchronicity of peatland development until recent thaw, with wetland initiation 8,500 cal yr BP followed by succession through peatland stages prior to permafrost aggradation 1,800 cal yr BP. Analysis and modeling of soil carbon stocks indicated 8.7 +/- 12.4 kg C m(-2) of carbon accumulated prior to thaw was lost in 200 years post-thaw. Despite these losses, there was no observed increase in peat humification as assessed by Fourier transform infrared and C:N ratios. Rapid peat accumulation post-thaw (9.8 +/- 1.6 kg C m(-2) over 200 years) offset deeper losses. Our approach constrains the net carbon balance to be between uptake of 27.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and loss of 106.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over 200 years post-thaw. While our approach cannot determine whether thermokarst bogs in the sporadic-discontinuous permafrost zone act as long-term carbon sinks or sources post-thaw, our study better constrains post-thaw C losses and gains. Plain Language Summary Northern peatlands store a third of the world's soil carbon, a store which has slowly accumulated over the last 10,000 years. A large amount of this soil carbon has become frozen in permafrost peatlands, but warming is causing these stores to thaw. Permafrost thaw in peatlands not only leads to potential decomposition of previously frozen peat but also leads to increased growth of mosses at the surface. Increased decomposition of previously frozen peat can release formerly trapped carbon into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases, thus accelerating ongoing climate warming, while increased moss growth would increase carbon storage. In this study, we investigated the long-term impact of thawing on peatland carbon storage. To do this, we measured the amount of previously frozen permafrost carbon that was lost following thaw and compared it to the amount that accumulated at the surface. We found no long-term net impact of permafrost thaw on carbon stores, as losses of previously frozen carbon were offset by carbon that accumulated at the surface following thaw. Our results rule out both large rapid losses and large gains of carbon following thaw in peatlands, which greatly help to constrain projections of carbon cycling at high latitudes in a warming world.","2020-03","2025-03-10 17:39:59","2025-03-12 12:52:49","","","","3","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000522353000018","3.7","2","SC: 0000056","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates how permafrost thaw does not lead to changes in carbon storage in thermokarst peatlands in northern Canada. </p> </div>","","","Canada; climate change; peatland; permafrost; permafrost thaw; decomposition; peat; substrate disturbance; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; cold climate; climate; carbon storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mercury was quantified using two approaches: sector-field ICP-MS of acid digests, and a Direct Mercury Analyser (DMA) for solid samples. Using ICP-MS, the mean Hg concentration in moss from the ABS region (34.7 +/- 1.5 mu g/kg, n = 75) was significantly greater than the control site, Utikuma (26.7 +/- 4.0 mu g/kg, n = 3). Using DMA, the mean Hg concentration in moss from the ABS region (26.2 +/- 0.9 mu g/kg, n = 71) was significantly lower than the control site (28.5 +/- 1.3 mu g/kg, n = 6). These contradictory findings illustrate the challenges associated with comparing the results of two analytical methods, especially given the similarity in Hg concentrations between industrial and background sites, Similar Hg concentrations were also found in Sphagnum moss from two other bogs in AB which are far removed from the ABS region. The Hg concentrations in Sphagnum from the ABS bogs are well below the range found in bog vegetation collected earlier in eastern Canada, and comparable to the lowest values (5th percentile) reported for forest moss collected in 2015 from Norway and Sphagnum moss sampled in 2008 from northern Sweden.

Peat erosion due to mechanical filling, vacuum harvest and rain can generate large suspended sediment concentrations that must be reduced before reaching the receiving waters. In this study, six sedimentation basins were monitored over one or two ice-free seasons, resulting in seven basin-years time series, to estimate their trapping efficiency. Using these data, two modelling approaches were first applied to predict the seasonal trapping efficiency of the basins, namely the Brown equation and a multilinear regression model (MLR). Secondly, an additional approach based on the hydrodynamic model MOHID was used to compute the trapping efficiency of one of the basins for a single rain event. The Brown equation, used worldwide in agricultural sedimentation ponds, proved to be less efficient in predicting the trapping efficiency of the basins (r = 0.67, p = 0.1, leave-one-out RMSE = 47.2%) than a MLR model using the volume of the basin, the surface of the harvested catchment and the Von Post decomposition degree of the peat as predictors (r = 0.87, p = 0.01, leave-one-out RMSE = 31.6%). The deterministic MOHID model was capable of reproducing high flow suspended sediment concentration at the basin outlet, based on measured settling velocity distribution of the peat through ViCAs protocol, but requires a good description of the settling velocity distribution across multiple hydrological conditions to simulate the suspended sediment concentrations over a full season in order to compute trapping efficiency. The results presented here provide new insights on eroded peat modelling and could lead to better design formulas for basin conception.","2019-08","2025-03-10 17:39:59","2025-03-12 12:54:53","","60-68","","","133","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000468148200007","3.8","2","SC: 0000016","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the efficiency of sediment ponds to trap peat particles from peat extraction fields. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peat; substrate disturbance; erosion; impact minimization; sedimentation ponds; water erosion; mitigation hierarchy; substrate; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The contribution of oil sands exploration to secondary organic aerosol formation, an important component of atmospheric particulate matter that affects air quality and climate(7), remains poorly understood. Here we use data from airborne measurements over the Canadian oil sands, laboratory experiments and a box-model study to provide a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of secondary organic aerosol production from oil sands emissions. We find that the evaporation and atmospheric oxidation of low-volatility organic vapours from the mined oil sands material is directly responsible for the majority of the observed secondary organic aerosol mass. The resultant production rates of 45-84 tonnes per day make the oil sands one of the largest sources of anthropogenic secondary organic aerosols in North America. Heavy oil and bitumen account for over ten per cent of global oil production today(8), and this figure continues to grow(9). Our findings suggest that the production of the more viscous crude oils could be a large source of secondary organic aerosols in many production and refining regions worldwide, and that such production should be considered when assessing the environmental impacts of current and planned bitumen and heavy oil extraction projects globally.","2016-06-02","2025-03-10 17:39:59","2025-03-12 12:55:06","","91-+","","7605","534","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000376962300039","64.8","1","SC: 0000171","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that the Alberta oil sand operations are important sources of hydrocarbons aerosols to the surrounding environment.</p> </div>","","","Canada; mining; mineral processing; pollution; air pollution; hydrocarbons; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, mosses should be included in rehabilitation projects following oil sands exploitation in north-western Canada. However, mosses growing in post-mined landscapes must tolerate elevated salinity levels found in oil sands process water (OSPW). Knowledge of salinity tolerance and thresholds for fen mosses is needed to place these mosses in the newly created landscapes. We tested the effects of NaCl and Na2SO4 on four fen moss species growing in Petri dishes in growth chambers. We simulated two scenarios: (1) four immersion times (1/4, 1, 3 and 7 days) in NaCl (0%, 20%, 60% or 100% of the concentration found in OSPW) mimicking periodic flooding and (2) a permanent saline influence (NaCl or Na2SO4 alone or in combination at 0%, 30%, 50% or 70% of the concentrations found in OSPW) mimicking situations of high water tables with different contamination levels. The effects on moss growth were estimated by counting new innovations of Bryum pseudotriquetrum, Campylium stellatum, Sphagnum warnstorfii and Tomenthypnum nitens. All tested mosses tolerated saline levels typically found in post-mined landscapes (up to 500 mg L-1 of NaCl and 400 mg L-1 of Na2SO4) for up to 100 days of exposure. Short periods of immersion (up to 7 days independently of salt concentrations) induced the production of innovation in non-Sphagnum species, but S. warnstorfii was more rapidly impacted at higher salt concentrations. Short pulses of salt (from 6 h to 7 days) did not influence the formation of new innovations for C. stellatum and T. nitens. Salt type (NaCl and/or Na2SO4) had no effect on moss growth. However, a longer exposure (100 days) with saline water, even at low concentrations, diminished the formation of new innovations for B. pseudotriquetrum and T. nitens. C. stellatum was the least affected by salinity and thus we suggest it is the best species to reintroduce in constructed fens. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrology also governs the maintenance of the methylating environments in the catchment. Specifically, hydrological processes maintain zones of anoxia in both the catchment uplands and peatlands that support obligate anaerobic sulphate-reducing bacteria.

Peat fires are dominated by smouldering combustion, which is ignited more readily than flaming combustion and can persist in wet conditions. In undisturbed peatlands, most of the peat carbon stock typically is protected from smouldering, and resistance to fire has led to a build-up of peat carbon storage in boreal and tropical regions over long timescales. But drying as a result of climate change and human activity lowers the water table in peatlands and increases the frequency and extent of peat fires. The combustion of deep peat affects older soil carbon that has not been part of the active carbon cycle for centuries to millennia, and thus will dictate the importance of peat fire emissions to the carbon cycle and feedbacks to the climate.","2015-01","2025-03-10 20:12:01","2025-03-12 12:52:37","2015-01-01","11-14","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000346825000007","18.3","1","SC: 0000855","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of increased fire in peatlands on carbon loss and consequent climate change. </p> </div>","","","fire; peatland; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; smouldering; cold climate; climate; carbon storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Field measurements were combined with numerical modeling of soil thermal dynamics to assess the roles of fire severity and climate history in postfire permafrost dynamics. Field-based calculations of potential thaw settlement following the loss of remaining ice-rich permafrost averaged 0.6 m. This subsidence would cause the surface elevations of forests to drop on average 0.1 m below the surface water level of adjacent collapse-scar features. Up to 0.5 m of thaw settlement was documented after recent fires, causing water impoundment and further thawing along forest margins. Substantial heterogeneity in soil properties (organic layer thickness, texture, moisture, and ice content) was attributed to differing site histories, which resulted in distinct soil thermal regimes by soil type. Model simulations showed increasing vulnerability of permafrost to deep thawing and thaw settlement with increased fire severity (i.e., reduced organic layer thickness). However, the thresholds of fire severity that triggered permafrost destabilization varied temporally in response to climate. Simulated permafrost dynamics underscore the importance of multiyear to multidecadal fluctuations in air temperature and snow depth in mediating the effects of fire on permafrost. Our results suggest that permafrost is becoming increasingly vulnerable to substantial thaw and collapse after moderate to high-severity fire, and the ability of permafrost to recover is diminishing as the climate continues to warm.","2015-08","2025-03-10 20:12:01","2025-03-12 12:52:52","2015-08-01","1619-1637","","8","120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000363332300012","3.7","2","SC: 0000158  Alaska Ecosci","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper describes the effects of fire and climate warming on permafrost peatlands in Alaska.</p> </div>","","","climate change; fire; hydrology; peatland; permafrost; permafrost thaw; substrate disturbance; flooding; cold climate; climate; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(3) Will the biodiversity of second-growth forests converge with that of primary boreal forests? (4) Are we losing species from boreal forests? We focus on trees, understory plants, insects, fungi, selected mammals, and songbirds because these groups have been most studied. We review more than 600 studies and found that changes in community composition are prevalent in response to large-scale conversion of forest types, changes in stand structures and age distributions, and altered landscape structure resulting from forest management and habitat loss associated with other developments such as oil and gas, hydroelectric, and mining. The southern boreal forest has been more highly impacted than the north due to more extensive forest management and the cumulative effects of multiple forms of development. There is abundant evidence that most species are not in danger of being extirpated from the boreal forest due to these anthropogenic changes. A few species, including woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), have, however, undergone long-term range contractions.

While many road studies have attempted to assess the effects of industrial noise on birds, conflicting factors such as edge effects often inhibit the ability to draw strong conclusions. 2 We assessed pairing success and age distribution of male ovenbirds Seiurus aurocapilla in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada, in areas around noise-generating compressor stations compared with areas around habitat-disturbed, but noiseless, wellpads. This allowed us to control for edge effects, human visitation and other factors that are not controlled for in studies of noise generated by roads. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to assess the impacts of noise on ovenbird pairing success, age structure and body morphology. 3 We found a significant reduction in ovenbird pairing success at compressor sites (77%) compared with noiseless wellpads (92%). These differences were apparent regardless of territory quality or individual male quality. Significantly more inexperienced birds breeding for the first time were found near noise-generating compressor stations than noiseless wellpads (48% vs. 30%). 4 While there are multiple proximate explanations for these results, the ultimate cause of the changes seems to be noise pollution. We hypothesize that noise interferes with a male's song, such that females may not hear the male's song at greater distances and/or females may perceive males to be of lower quality because of distortion of song characteristics. 5 Synthesis and applications. This work demonstrates that chronic background noise could be an important factor affecting bird populations. It can impact upon pairing success and age structure of passerines; in boreal Alberta this could pose a problem for certain species as energy development expands rapidly.","2007-02-01","2025-03-11 14:22:20","2025-03-12 20:04:59","2025-03-11","176-184","","1","44","","Journal of Applied Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.7","1","SC: 0000441  Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper describes the effect of chronic noise pollution from Alberta oil sand mining on the reproduction of ovenbirds.</p> </div>","","","Canada; mining; migratory birds; fauna; birds; other stressors; noise pollution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of human activities in forests are often examined in the context of habitat conversion. Changes in habitat structure and composition are also associated with increases in the activity of people with vehicles and equipment, which results in increases in anthropogenic noise. Anthropogenic noise may reduce habitat quality for many species, particularly those that rely on acoustic signals for communication. We compared the density and occupancy rate of forest passerines close to versus far from noise-generating compressor stations and noiseless well pads in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada. Using distance-based sampling, we found that areas near noiseless energy facilities had a total passerine density 1.5 times higher than areas near noise-producing energy sites. The White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), Yellow-rumped Warbler (Dendroica coronata), and Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus) were less dense in noisy areas. We used repeat sampling to estimate occupancy rate for 23 additional species. Seven had lower conditional or unconditional occupancy rates near noise-generating facilities. One-third of the species examined showed patterns that supported the hypothesis that abundance is influenced by anthropogenic noise. An additional 4 species responded negatively to edge effects. To mitigate existing noise impacts on birds would require approximately $175 million. The merits of such an effort relative to other reclamation actions are discussed. Nevertheless, given the $100 billion energy-sector investment planned for the boreal forest in the next 10 years, including noise suppression technology at the outset of construction, makes noise mitigation a cost-effective best-management practice that might help conserve high-quality habitat for boreal birds.","2008-10-01","2025-03-11 14:29:11","2025-03-12 20:05:17","2025-03-11","1186-1193","","5","22","","Conservation Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","6.3","1","SC: 0000411  Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of impact of chronic noise on songbird populations in the Alberta oil sands, including white-throated sparrow, yellow-rumped warbler and red-eyed vireo.

Consistent with the hypothesis that habitat loss may be driving declines, trends in adult captures, productivity, and survival were all more negative at stations with larger increases in disturbance over the study period. Species associated with early seral stages were more commonly captured at more disturbed stations, while species typical of mature forests were more commonly captured at less disturbed stations. Productivity was positively correlated with disturbance within 5-km of stations after controlling for disturbance within 1-km of stations, suggesting the importance of earlier successional habitat for post-fledging birds in the larger landscape. Adult apparent survival showed relatively little response to disturbance; stresses experienced beyond the breeding grounds likely play a larger role in influencing survival. Residency probability was negatively related to disturbance within 1-km scale of stations and could reflect processes affecting the ability of birds to establish or maintain territories in disturbed landscapes. We conclude that successional habitats that result from natural regeneration or restoration in disturbed areas, as well as decreased future footprint through recovery of mature forests and limiting of new disturbances, will both be important components of efforts to reverse population declines and maintain bird populations in the region.• Habitat loss and disturbance can affect the demography and trends of bird populations.• We used avian monitoring data from 2011 to 2020 and anthropogenic disturbance data (human footprint) at two spatial scales (1-km and 5-km radius) from a network of bird-banding stations in the Athabasca oil sands region of Alberta, Canada, to assess trends in, and disturbance effects on, the abundance and demography of 31 breeding bird species.• Abundance and demographic parameters declined, and trends in abundance, productivity, and adult apparent survival were all more negative at sites with increasing footprint; thus, decreasing future human footprint through habitat recovery in reclaimed industrial areas and limiting of new industrial disturbances will be critical for efforts to reverse bird population declines.• Positive responses of an index of abundance (adult captures) and productivity of at least some species to disturbance at one or both spatial scales also suggest an important role for successional habitats that develop in the wake of disturbance as part of regional conservation efforts.","2022-11-03","2025-03-11 15:18:33","2025-03-12 12:53:57","2025-11-03","duac037","","4","124","","Ornithological Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.4","","SC: 0000003","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines a decade of data to determine that landscape fragmentation and ecosystem conversion has caused declines of bird populations in the Alberta oil sands.</p> </div>","","","Canada; mining; ecosystem conversion; migratory birds; fauna; birds; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A trait‐based, mechanistic understanding of community assembly holds promise for wetland conservation, but this has been rarely examined across scales. We examined: (a) the relative influence of climate, landscape matrix, and local physicochemistry on invasion intensity and functional diversity in boreal wetland plant assemblages; and (b) the ecological traits linked to these environmental factors. Location  One hundred fifty‐three wetlands across the Boreal Forest of Alberta, Canada. Methods  We used data on invasion intensity, using two terrestrial invaders (Sonchus arvensis and Cirsium arvense), and environmental factors at local and landscape levels. We used eight traits from 366 vascular plants to assess functional diversity and invasion responses to environmental gradients (generalized linear models) and individual species trait–environment relationships (community‐weighted mean redundancy analysis, fourth‐corner analysis). Results  Landscape matrix and the degree of invasion were the primary drivers of functional diversity, while invasion intensity was driven by physicochemistry and functional diversity. Community trait–environment patterns clearly separated wetlands by invasion status. Uninvaded wetlands were surrounded by lowland conifers and composed of stress‐tolerant associated traits, while invaded wetlands contained high levels of disturbance and traits associated with high resource availability and reproduction rates. This division was further supported by individual trait–environment relationships. Conclusions  Landscape matrix was the dominant driver of functional diversity and composition pattern, while the local physicochemistry and surrounding land‐cover matrix helped explain invasion. Our analysis revealed some of the mechanistic relationships shaping plant community assembly across boreal wetlands, information that can help resource managers identify, predict, and alleviate possible threats from landscape anthropogenic disturbances to wetland ecological integrity.","2021","2025-03-11 15:21:31","2025-03-12 12:54:52","","n/a-n/a","","5","32","","Journal of Vegetation Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.8","3","SC: 0000009  Publisher: Wiley","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the controls of invasive species (Sonchus arvensis and Cirsium arvense) in wetlands in the Alberta oil sands region.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; vegetation; mining; vascular plants; other wetland; ecosystem conversion; invasive species; functional types; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are used to monitor populations and ecosystems and to study various aspects of animal behavior. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) can record sound in most environments and are increasingly used by researchers to conduct acoustic surveys for birds. In this review, we summarize the use of ARUs in avian ecological research and synthesize current knowledge of the benefits and drawbacks of this technology. ARUs enable researchers to do more repeat visits with less time spent in the field, with the added benefits of a permanent record of the data collected and reduced observer bias. They are useful in remote locations and for targeting rare species. ARUs are mostly comparable to human observers in terms of species richness, but in some cases, they detect fewer species and at shorter distances. Drawbacks of ARUs include the cost of equipment, storage of recordings, loss of data if units fail, and potential sampling trade-offs in spatial vs. temporal coverage. ARUs generate large data sets of audio recordings, but advances in automated species recognition and acoustic processing techniques are contributing to make the processing time manageable. Future applications of ARUs include biodiversity monitoring and studying habitat use, animal movement, and various behavioral ecology questions based on vocalization activity. ARUs have the potential to make significant advances in avian ecological research and to be used in more innovative ways than simply as a substitute for a human observer in the field.","2017","2025-03-11 15:30:43","2025-03-23 16:43:37","","","","1","12","","Avian Conservation and Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","1.4","3","SC: 0000380  Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents methods for automated acoustical surveys for birds.</p> </div>","","","remote sensing; monitoring; migratory birds; fauna; birds; other stressors; automated acoustic survey; noise pollution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bird-building collisions primarily occur at glass surfaces: birds often fail to perceive glass as a barrier and appear to be attracted to artificial light emitted from windows. However, some aspects of avian vision are poorly understood, including how bird responses to different types of light influence building collisions. Some evidence suggests birds can detect polarized light, which may serve as a cue to assist with migration orientation and/or detect water bodies. Dark, reflective surfaces, including glass, reflect high degrees of polarized light, causing polarized light pollution (PLP). However, no studies have analyzed the relationship between bird collisions and PLP reflected from buildings. Additionally, while artificial light at night (ALAN) is frequently implicated as a major factor influencing bird-building collisions, few studies have analyzed this relationship. We investigated both types of light pollution—PLP and ALAN—and their association with bird collisions at 48 façades of 13 buildings in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. We found that the area of glass emitting ALAN was the most important factor influencing collisions, and that this effect of ALAN was independent of overall glass area; this result provides strong support for turning off lights at night to reduce bird-building collisions. Although we found no relationship between PLP and collisions, additional research is needed to better understand bird responses to polarized light. Fully understanding how different aspects of light influence bird-building collisions can inform conservation efforts to reduce this major threat to birds.","2020-01-01","2025-03-11 19:46:47","2025-03-12 20:07:13","","108358","","","241","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.9","1","SC: 0000089","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the effects of nighttime light pollution for causing bird collisions. </p> </div>","","","migratory birds; fauna; birds; other stressors; wildlife collisions; light pollution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite ongoing development and increases in infrastructure, we have few estimates of the magnitude of collision mortality. We reviewed the existing literature on avian mortality associated with transmission lines and derived an initial estimate for Canada. Estimating mortality from collisions with power lines is challenging due to the lack of studies, especially from sites within Canada, and due to uncertainty about the magnitude of detection biases. Detection of bird collisions with transmission lines varies due to habitat type, species size, and scavenging rates. In addition, birds can be crippled by the impact and subsequently die, although crippling rates are poorly known and rarely incorporated into estimates. We used existing data to derive a range of estimates of avian mortality associated with collisions with transmission lines in Canada by incorporating detection, scavenging, and crippling biases. There are 231,966 km of transmission lines across Canada, mostly in the boreal forest. Mortality estimates ranged from 1 million to 229.5 million birds per year, depending on the bias corrections applied. We consider our most realistic estimate, taking into account variation in risk across Canada, to range from 2.5 million to 25.6 million birds killed per year. Data from multiple studies across Canada and the northern U.S. indicate that the most vulnerable bird groups are (1) waterfowl, (2) grebes, (3) shorebirds, and (4) cranes, which is consistent with other studies. Populations of several groups that are vulnerable to collisions are increasing across Canada (e.g., waterfowl, raptors), which suggests that collision mortality, at current levels, is not limiting population growth. However, there may be impacts on other declining species, such as shorebirds and some species at risk, including Alberta’s Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) and western Canada’s endangered Whooping Cranes (Grus americana). Collisions may be more common during migration, which underscores the need to understand impacts across the annual cycle. We emphasize that these estimates are preliminary, especially considering the absence of Canadian studies.","2013","2025-03-11 20:00:44","2025-03-12 20:06:55","","","","2","8","","Avian Conservation and Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","1.4","3","SC: 0000088  Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the impact of transmission lines on bird collisions.</p> </div>","","","Canada; transmission lines; impact minimization; migratory birds; mitigation hierarchy; fauna; birds; other stressors; wildlife collisions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasing the visibility of these structures may reduce collisions but may only be accepted by local residents if it does not create a visual disturbance.  Recent research has shown the potential for ultraviolet (UV) light, which is nearly imperceptible to humans, to mitigate avian collisions with anthropogenic structures.  We tested the effectiveness of two UV (390–400 nm) Avian Collision Avoidance Systems (ACASs) at reducing collisions at two 260-m spans of marked power lines at the Iain Nicolson Audubon Center at Rowe Sanctuary, an important migratory bird stopover location in Nebraska.  We used a randomized design and a tiered model selection approach employing generalized linear models and the Akaike Information Criterion to assess the effectiveness of ACASs considering environmental (e.g., precipitation) and detection probability (e.g., migration chronology) variables. We found focal (assessed power line) and distal (neighboring power line) ACAS status and environmental variables were important predictors of avian collisions.  Our top model suggests that the focal ACAS illumination reduced collisions by 88%, collisions were more likely at moderate (10–16 km/h) compared to lower or higher wind speeds, and collision frequency decreased with precipitation occurrence. Our top model also indicates that the distal ACAS illumination reduced collisions by 39.4% at the focal power line when that ACAS was off, suggesting a positive “neighbor effect” of power line illumination.  Although future applications of ACASs would benefit from additional study to check for potential negative effects (for example, collisions involving nocturnal foragers such as bats or caprimulgiform birds drawn to insects), we suggest that illuminating power lines, guy wires, towers, wind turbines, and other anthropogenic structures with UV illumination will likely lower collision risks for birds while increasing human acceptance of mitigation measures in urban areas.","2022","2025-03-11 20:00:55","2025-03-12 20:07:04","","","","2","17","","Avian Conservation and Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","1.4","3","Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents a method using UV lights to minimize bird collisions with power lines and other similar structures..</p> </div>","","","linear disturbance; transmission lines; impact minimization; migratory birds; mitigation hierarchy; fauna; birds; other stressors; wildlife collisions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On land, the majority of the sequestered carbon enters soil carbon stores. Almost one-third of that soil carbon can be found in peatlands, an area covering just 2–3% of the Earth’s landmass. Peatlands are thus well established as powerful agents of carbon capture and storage; the preservation of archaeological artefacts, such as ancient bog bodies, further attest to their exceptional preservative properties. Peatlands have higher carbon storage densities per unit ecosystem area than either the oceans or dry terrestrial systems. However, despite attempts over a number of years at enhancing carbon capture in the oceans or in land-based afforestation schemes, no attempt has yet been made to optimize peatland carbon storage capacity or even to harness peatlands to store externally captured carbon. Recent studies suggest that peatland carbon sequestration is due to the inhibitory effects of phenolic compounds that create an ‘enzymic latch’ on decomposition.

The natural carbon storage function of these ecosystems can be severely impacted due to peatland drainage and peat extraction, leading to large and persistent sources of atmospheric CO2 following peat extraction abandonment. Standard restoration techniques aim to restore the peatland to a carbon-accumulating system through various water management techniques to improve hydrological conditions and through reintroducing Sphagnum at the surface. However, restoring the hydrology of peatlands can be expensive due to the cost of implementing the various restoration techniques. This study examines the net ecosystem CO2 exchange of a new extraction—restoration technique where the acrotelm is preserved and replaced directly on the cutover surface. Peat respiration at the experimental restored acrotelm (110.5 g C·m−2over the study period: May 20–August 18) was significantly lower than at the natural peatland (144.8 and 203.7 g C·m−2, wet and dry plots respectively). However, gross ecosystem production (GEP) at the experimental site was significantly reduced (-54.0 and -34.4 g C·m−2) compared to the natural site (-179.2 and -162.0 g C·m−2). Consequently, this was a growing season net emitter of CO2 to the atmosphere over the season at the experimental site (78.5 and 56.5 g C·m−2 and a growing season sink of CO2 at the natural site (-17.6 and -22.8 g C·m−2). Light response curves indicated that maximum GEP was significantly lower at the experimental site; however, it is likely that the percentage of living and dead vegetation at the plots post restoration had a large control on this lower productivity as plots with more living vegetation had higher overall productivity (GEP). Nevertheless, the experimental site did maintain limited productivity post-extraction, indicating that the carbon dynamics of the system was maintained due to this acrotelm restoration process, thereby likely returning the ecosystem toward a natural sink of atmospheric CO2 faster than natural rehabilitation and current restoration techniques. As such, this approach to peat extraction may be an environmentally preferred approach to use.","2008-06-01","2025-03-11 23:00:37","2025-03-12 14:01:28","","258-267","","2","15","","Écoscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This study examines the net ecosystem CO2 exchange of a new restoration technique where the acrotelm peat is preserved and replaced directly on top of a peat extraction surface. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; greenhouse gases; peat; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; substrate; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the literature on shallow aquifers is vast, groundwater response to precipitation in peatlands has received little attention so far. Characterizing groundwater response to precipitation events in differently managed peatlands can give insight into ecohydrological processes. In this study we determined the groundwater table response rate following precipitation events at a drained and a rewetted fen to characterize the effect of rewetting on hydrological buffer capacity. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the groundwater table at the rewetted fen has more than two times lower rate of response to precipitation events than that of the drained fen, even after adjusting for antecedent groundwater levels. Thus, the rewetted fen delivers a better hydrological buffer function against heavy precipitation events than the drained fen. We found that for the depths at which the groundwater interacts with incoming precipitation, the peat of the rewetted fen has a higher specific yield causing groundwater to rise slower compared to the response at the drained fen. A period of 20 years of rewetting was sufficient to form a new layer of organic material with a significant fraction of macropores providing storage capacity. Long-term rewetting has the potential to create favorable conditions for new peat accumulation, thereby altering water table response.

Maintaining a high water table through rewetting is an effective measure to rehabilitate many of their ecosystem functions. However, the impact of meteorological conditions such as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and precipitation on water tables is still unclear for rewetted fens. Here, we compare the impact of meteorological factors on water table dynamics in a drained and a rewetted fen, using multiple regression with data from continuous high-resolution (temporal) water level monitoring and weather stations. We find that an increase in the daily mean VPD causes a higher drop in the water table at the drained and degraded fen compared to the rewetted fen. Precipitation contributes to recharge, causing the water table to rise higher at the drained site than at the rewetted site. We attribute the differential influence of meteorological conditions on water table dynamics to different soil specific yield values (i.e., water storage capacity) largely driven by lower water table position at the drained site. Our study underlines the importance of understanding how and why water tables in peatlands vary in response to meteorological factors for management decisions (e.g., rewetting).

We restored all or portions of each wetland, including fens, wet meadows and riparian areas, during 1997–2002. Intensive pre- and post-construction monitoring was used to develop restoration plans and evaluate their success. We revisited the sites to analyze long-term restoration processes in 2013–2016. Prior to construction the depth to the water table was measured weekly in monitoring wells installed through the fill, and into the wetland surfaces during and following restoration. Reference sites for each wetland type were used to characterize water table depth and vegetation for each wetland type. Restoration included removal of fill material and drains to create land surfaces with water table depth and dynamics similar to the reference areas for each wetland type. We planted each site with nursery grown sedges, willows and herbaceous dicots. Post restoration monitoring of water table depth, vegetation composition, sedge shoot density and willow growth was analyzed. The water table depth and dynamics of each restored wetland was similar to suitable reference sites on short and long time scales, indicating a stable hydrologic regime. Carex utriculata reached its maximum shoot density 4–5 years after planting indicating rapid growth and high production. Willow stems were still increasing in height 15 years after planting and basal stem density was also increasing. Most planted herbaceous dicots disappeared, indicating the difficulty of establishing them from plantings. Exotic (non-native) plants have invaded all three wetland types, with their highest cover in riparian areas. Critical factors that led to success were careful hydrological analysis of reference and restoration sites prior to earthwork, creating appropriate land/ground water interactions, and establishing clonal rhizomatous sedges and native willows.","2017-04","2025-03-12 16:31:08","2025-03-17 19:33:14","2025-03-12 16:31:08","46-59","","","101","","Ecological Engineering","Mountain wetland restoration","","","","","","","en","","","","","3.8","2","SC: 0000042","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines how rewetted and replanted fens and other wetlands have recovered following their restoration.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; other wetland; substrate disturbance; water table; rewetting; fen; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; graminoids; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this assumption is based on limited study of fen water table dynamics. Here we monitor water table fluctuation in distributed locations across three calcareous fens differing in hydrogeomorphic setting for three growing seasons. Water table position was extremely variable with absolute ranges of 89, > 100, and > 118 cm in the Riparian, Trough and Basin Fens, respectively, and was controlled by landscape position and weather variability. Areas adjacent to a second‐order stream experienced the least water table fluctuation, while the Basin Fen, at > 75 m from a surface water connection, was very prone to year‐to‐year precipitation differences. Mean and median water table values were found to be poor indicators of biologically relevant hydroperiods. We introduce the term ‘duration of initial growing season saturation’ as a potentially more useful statistic to relate to plant species distribution. Across the studied fens, this duration ranged from 1 to 14 weeks from the start of the growing season. The water table resided below the ground surface for between 0 and 22 weeks of the growing season across the calcareous fens and study period. These findings impart great differences in the development of oxidized rooting depths.

As an initial restoration effort, the primary drainage network of an abandoned cutover peatland was blocked with a series of peat dams, consequently reducing the runoff efficiency and causing the site-average water table to rise by 32 cm. Higher water tables and a blocked drainage network resulted in increased runoff variability, dependent upon antecedent conditions (capacity to retain additional water on-site), and event-based precipitation dynamics. Evapotranspiration (ET) rates were 25% higher following rewetting (3.6 mm day−1) compared to pre-restoration ET rates of 2.7 mm day−1. Total storage changes were restricted following rewetting, as a factor of the reduced runoff losses limiting water table drawdown, thereby constraining peat compression and preventing undue drying of the unsaturated zone. An average surface level rebound of 3 cm was observed, increasing the mean hydraulic conductivity by an order of magnitude.

How does the hydrological system sustain base-rich fen mires and fen meadows? Location: Interdunal wetlands and heathland pools in The Netherlands, percolation mires in Germany, Poland, and Siberia, and calcareous spring fens in the High Tatra, Slovakia. Methods: This review presents an overview of the hydrological conditions of fen mires and fen meadows that are highly valued in nature conservation due to their high biodiversity and the occurrence of many Red List species. Fen types covered in this review include: (1) small hydrological systems in young calcareous dune areas, and (2) small hydrological systems in decalcified old cover sand areas in The Netherlands; (3) large hydrological systems in river valleys in Central-Europe and western-Siberia, and (4) large hydrological systems of small calcareous spring fens with active precipitation of travertine in mountain areas of Slovakia. Results: Different landscape types can sustain similar nutrient poor and base-rich habitats required by endangered fen meadow species. The hydrological systems of these landscapes are very different in size, but their ground water flow pattern is remarkably similar. Paleoecological research showed that travertine forming fen vegetation types persisted in German lowland percolation mires from 6000 to 3000 BP. Similar vegetation types can still be found in small mountain mires in the Slovak Republic. Small pools in such mires form a cascade of surface water bodies that stimulate travertine formation in various ways. Travertine deposition prevents acidification of the mire and sustains populations of basiphilous species that elsewhere in Europe are highly endangered. Conclusion: Very different hydrological landscape settings can maintain a regular flow of groundwater through the top soil generating similar base-rich site conditions. This is why some fen species occur in very different landscape types, ranging from mineral interdunal wetlands to mountain mires.","2006-11","2025-03-13 13:20:35","2025-03-17 19:43:36","","175-184","","2","9","","Applied Vegetation Science","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","2.8","3","SC: 0000163","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the hydrological and biogeochemical controls of calcareous rich fens across Europe.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; hydrology; peatland; nutrients; groundwater; electrical conductivity; fen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Functional traits provide a quantitative link between vegetation and ecosystem functions and, therefore, constitute a useful concept for predicting responses to climate change. We studied the impact of long‐term experimental WLD on vascular plant and moss traits at a rich fen, poor fen and bog. Vegetation change was followed over a 15‐year period. In the final study year, the traits of the most common plant species were measured from control and WLD areas at each peatland type. We found equally high interspecific trait variation for Sphagnum mosses and vascular plants while the intraspecific variation was greater in the mosses. Community‐weighted mean (CWM) traits varied between sites; WLD had the strongest impact on those traits that the dominant plant group originally had high values for, and in most cases, WLD further increased these values. In the vascular‐plant‐dominated rich fen, WLD led to taller plants with a greater specific leaf area, features that under the prevailing water table were also greatest at that site. In the bog, characterized by dense Sphagnum moss stands with small individuals, WLD further enhanced these properties that increase the ability of a moss stand to remain moist under drier conditions. The poor fen was transitional between the two extremes, both in its vegetation composition and in its trait responses. Structural equation models (SEM) showed that WLD in the fens, indirectly via other traits, increased photosynthetic capacity while the impact in the bog site was the opposite. In the poor fen and bog, WLD directly increased vascular plant respiration while the increase in the rich fen was through other traits. WLD directly increased and decreased Sphagnum respiration in the poor fen and bog, respectively. Overall, the traits of the vascular plant and Sphagnum communities in the bog were more dependent on each other than they were in the fens. Based on these findings, it is evident that fens and bogs respond differently to WLD. This should be considered when predicting the effects of climate change on peatland carbon cycling.","2021-10","2025-03-13 13:31:12","2025-03-18 12:26:24","2025-03-13 13:31:12","2342-2357","","10","35","","Functional Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","5.2","1","SC: 0000021","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper shows that water level drawdown has opposite effects for peatland functional types in rich fens versus bogs, with poor fens being intermediate.</p> </div>","","","peatland; vegetation; bog; drawdown; bryophytes; sphagnum; fen; functional types; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Location: Newham Bog National Nature Reserve, Northumberland, UK, a site with a long history of active management, and recorded as drought‐sensitive over the last 100 years. Methods: Water level readings are correlated with longer‐term hydrological databases, and these data related to vegetation data collected intermittently over a 12 year period. Two analyses are undertaken: (1) a composite DCA analysis of 1993 and 2002 survey data to assess plant community transitions within the wetland and over time, and (2) analysis of recent vegetation data to explore wider vegetation gradients. This allows (3) communities to be classified using NVC classes and (4) integrated with revised Ellenberg F‐values. Results: Drought impact and subsequent hydrological recovery over a 22‐year period are quantified. Vegetation data display strong moisture and successional gradients. Analysis shows a shift from grassland communities toward mire communities across much of the site. Conclusion: The site is regionally unique in that it has a detailed long‐term monitoring record. Hydrological data and vegetation survey have allowed the impact of the most recent ‘groundwater’drought (1989–1997) to be quantified.

Therefore, the joint prediction of suitable habitat and seed dispersal in dependency of management actions is required for effective nature management. Here we demonstrate an approach, which links a habitat suitability and a seed dispersal model. The linked model describes potential species distribution as a function of current species distribution, species-specific dispersal traits, the number of successful dispersal events, dispersal infrastructure and habitat configuration. The last two variables were related to water management actions. We demonstrate the applicability of the model in a strategy analysis of hydrological restoration measures for a large fen area in which still numerous endangered plant species grow. With the aid of the linked model, we were able to optimise the spatial planning of restoration measures, taking into account both the constraints of water management practices on abiotic restoration and the effects of habitat fragmentation on dispersal. Moreover, we could demonstrate that stand-alone habitat suitability models, which assume unlimited dispersal, may considerably overestimate restoration prospects. For these reasons, we conclude that linked habitat suitability and dispersal models can provide useful insights into spatially differentiated potentials and constraints of nature restoration measures targeted at the sustainable conservation of endangered plant populations whose habitats have been deteriorated due to undesirable effects of land and water management on abiotic conditions. These insights may contribute to the design of cost-effective nature restoration and conservation measures.","2011-03","2025-03-13 13:38:24","2025-03-18 14:56:49","2025-03-13 13:38:24","1025-1035","","3","144","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","5.9","1","SC: 0000026","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that habitat suitability must be coupled with seed source availability (or introductions) to predict restoration outcomes in rewetted rich fens. </p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; fen; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How is plant species richness affected, and what are the changes in composition of ecological groups of species? Is it possible to recover parts of the original flora by rewetting the rich fen? Which are the initial vegetation changes in the flora after rewetting? What are the major challenges for restoration of rich fen flora after rewetting? Location: Eastern central Sweden, southern boreal vegetational zone. Previously rich fen site, drained for forestry purposes during 1978–1979. The site was hydrologically restored (rewetted) in 2002.           Method: Annual vegetation survey in permanent plots during a period of 28 years.          Results: There were three successional stages in the vegetational changes. In the first stage there was a rapid (< 5 years) loss of rich fen bryophytes. The second step was an increase of sedges and early successional bryophytes, which was followed by an increase of a few emerging dominants, such as Molinia caerulea, Betula pubescens and Sphagnum spp. After rewetting, there are indications of vegetation recovery, albeit at slow rates. Depending on, for instance, initial species composition different routes of vegetation change were observed in the flora after drainage, although after 24 years, species composition became more homogenous and dominated by a few species with high cover. Conclusion: Major changes have occurred after changes in the hydrology (drainage and rewetting) with a severe impact on the biodiversity among vascular plants and bryophytes. Several rich fen bryophytes respond quickly to the changes in water level (in contrast to vascular plants). The recovery after rewetting towards the original rich fen vegetation is slow, as delayed by substrate degradation, dispersal limitation and presence of dominant species.","2008-02","2025-03-13 13:39:21","2025-10-02 14:22:32","","99-106","","1","11","","Applied Vegetation Science","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","2.8","3","SC: 0000133","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper uses studies of permanent plots to describe the effects of long-term drainage and recent rewetting on the vegetation of a rich fen in Europe.</p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; peat; water table; drawdown; rewetting; bryophytes; sphagnum; fen; mitigation hierarchy; substrate; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; brown mosses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared drained and undrained portions 45 years after the installation of a drainage ditch network, which has lowered water levels of 15–20 cm on average in the drained part of the site. Although shrub fine root production did not differ significantly between sites, water table drawdown increased belowground tree fine root production by 740% (3.8 ± 5.4 SD and 28.1 ± 24.1 g m−2 y−1 in undrained and drained sites, respectively) at the expense of herb root production, which declined 38% (27.62 ± 16.40 and 10.58 ± 15.7 g m−2 y−1 in undrained and drained sites, respectively) yielding no significant overall change in total fine root production. Drainage effects on aboveground biomass showed a similar pattern among plant types, as aboveground tree biomass increased dramatically with drainage (79 ± 135 and 2546 ± 1551 g m−2 in drained and undrained sites, respectively). Although total shrub biomass was not significantly different between sites, shrubs allocated more biomass to stems than leaves in the drained site. Drainage also caused a significant shift in shrub species composition. Although trees dominated the aboveground biomass following water table drawdown, understorey vegetation, mainly shrubs, continued to dominate belowground fine root production, comprising 64% of total root production at the drained site. Aboveground biomass proved to be a good predictor of belowground production, suggesting that allometric relationships can be developed to estimate belowground production in these systems. Increase in tree root production can counteract decrease in herb fine root production following water table drawdown, emphasizing the importance of plant functional type responses to water table drawdown. Whether these changes will offset ecosystem C loss via increased plant C storage or stimulate soil organic matter decomposition via increased above- and belowground litter inputs requires further study.","2009-12","2025-03-13 14:03:13","2025-03-18 13:59:58","2025-03-13 14:03:13","1268-1282","","8","12","","Ecosystems","","","","","","","","en","http://www.springer.com/tdm","","","","3.7","2","SC: 0000124","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effect of lowering the water table on the above and belowground biomass in a boreal bog.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; bog; drawdown; woody plants; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Draining peatlands coupled with warming releases stored carbon, and subsequent rewetting may or may not restore the original carbon sink. Yet, patterns of plant production and decomposition in rewetted peatlands and how they compare to drained conditions remain largely unexplored. Here, we measured annual above- and belowground biomass production and decomposition in three different drained and rewetted peatland types: alder forest, percolation fen and coastal fen during an exceptionally dry year. We also used standard plant material to compare decomposition between the sites, regardless of the decomposability of the local plant material. Rewetted sites showed higher root and shoot production in the percolation fen and higher root production in the coastal fen, but similar root and leaf production in the alder forest. Decomposition rates were generally similar in drained and rewetted sites, only in the percolation fen and alder forest did aboveground litter decompose faster in the drained sites. The rewetted percolation fen and the two coastal sites had the highest projected potential for organic matter accumulation. Roots accounted for 23–66% of total biomass production, and belowground biomass, rather than aboveground biomass, was particularly important for organic matter accumulation in the coastal fens. This highlights the significance of roots as main peat-forming element in these graminoid-dominated fen peatlands and their crucial role in carbon cycling, and shows that high biomass production supported the peatlands’ function as carbon sink even during a dry year.","2021-08","2025-03-13 14:15:29","2025-03-18 14:43:10","2025-03-13 14:15:29","1093-1109","","5","24","","Ecosystems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","3.7","2","SC: 0000048","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates how rewetting of drained fen peatlands increases primary production of roots and consequently increases carbon sequestration.</p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; decomposition; carbon sequestration; drawdown; rewetting; carbon cycle; primary productivity; fen; mitigation hierarchy; graminoids; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Study species included twenty species of perennial herbs, shrubs and trees occurring frequently in undisturbed bogs or abandoned milled bogs in Québec, Canada. First, a glasshouse experiment was performed to test the effect of burial under peat on germination and seedling emergence. Second, a growth chamber experiment was conducted to measure relative growth rate and other growth parameters of seedlings between 1 and 3 weeks of age. In the burial experiment, seedling emergence decreased exponentially with peat depth for most species examined. The slope of the exponential decline varied between species and was strongly correlated to seed mass. Seeds less than 0.1 mg in mass were most sensitive to burial. In the seedling growth experiments, Betula species had the highest absolute and relative growth rates, which may help to explain their prevalence in milled bogs. Relative growth rate (RGR) was not correlated with seed mass, however it was strongly correlated with leaf area ratio (LAR) and especially specific leaf area (SLA) of seedlings, except for species with seed mass less than 0.01 mg. Screening of species for seed mass and SLA should help predict their germination and establishment success or failure in milled peatlands and allow more directed interventions to favour the establishment of desirable species in milled bogs.","2003","2025-03-13 14:18:01","2025-03-14 17:54:32","","71-84","","","169.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1.7","4","SC: 0000053","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the germination and seedling growth of vascular plant species that are either common in peatlands in Québec or naturally recolonize peatlands in Québec.

The goal was to establish baseline knowledge for the species pool in severely disturbed sites prior to restoration. The method was based on the identification of potential colonists, inventories of populations in surrounding vegetation and autecological information on their maximum fecundity and dispersal by wind, water or animals. 2 The method was applied to milled peatlands in south-eastern Quebec, Canada, after the cessation of peat extraction activities. Thirty-two species, ranging from mosses to trees, which are common in natural or abandoned milled peatlands in southern Quebec, were selected as potential colonists. 3 Populations of study species differed markedly in edges of milled peatlands in terms of their abundance, presence and presence of fertile plants. An edge effect was apparent where the populations of many species varied as a function of distance from milled surfaces, caused, in part, by drainage. 4 Mosses had relatively high potential to immigrate to milled bogs because of their high fecundity and the wind-dispersal ability of their spores. The scarcity of mosses in abandoned milled bogs did not appear to be a result of the lack of immigrant propagules. Herbs had relatively low immigration potential, due to their rarity in edges, but herbs such as Eriophorum vaginatum were able to recolonize milled bogs in spite of this low potential. Shrub species generally had high immigration potential because of their abundance at edges and the high dispersal ability of propagules by wind, water and animals. Trees had high immigration potential due to their abundance at edges and their wind-dispersal abilities. 5 Synthesis and applications. An index of immigration potential provides information on the probable initial species pool after severe disturbance, against which the effects of local habitat suitability and establishment factors can be added to assess probable successional patterns. Its flexibility and applicability to varied life forms should make it useful for diagnosing recolonization bottlenecks in a wide variety of disturbance and restoration situations. It also allows for an assessment of the relative need for introducing species during the restoration of severely disturbed environments.","2003","2025-03-13 14:18:01","2025-03-20 18:32:02","","78-91","","","40","","J .

This study examines the effectiveness of using shallow (20 cm deep) basins of various widths to improve the success of current peatland restoration techniques. It comprises three different experiments, each spanning three or four growing seasons and combining both small-scale manual and large-scale mechanized plant reintroductions. Cover data recorded in two of the experiments were regressed against a series of environmental factors to determine how Sphagnum establishment success was related to abiotic variables such as moisture, water ponding, surface roughness, and mulch cover. Results of these experiments demonstrate that shallow basins were generally effective at promoting Sphagnum establishment and that this effect extends beyond the positive impact that basins have on hydrological conditions. Basins of various widths were equally successful. Soil-moisture content (linear positive effect) and duration and severity of flooding events (quadratic effect) were shown to be determinant of plant recovery. Other factors such as the density of straw cover (positive effect) and surface roughness (negative effect) were also instrumental in explaining local variation in Sphagnum cover. Plant cover after three and four growing seasons averaged 20-25% in mechanical reintroductions and 40-60% in manual reintroductions, demonstrating the overall effectiveness of the restoration techniques used.","2004","2025-03-13 14:18:01","2025-03-22 19:20:47","","471-482","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.2","2","SC: 0000054","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper tests whether the use of shallow basins to retain water helps the restoration of post-extracted peatlands using the moss layer transfer technique.</p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; substrate disturbance; soil moisture; bryophytes; sphagnum; active restoration; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Location: Rivière-du-Loup peatland, southern Québec, Canada at 100 m a.s.1. Methods: The effectiveness of introducing fen plants with the application of donor diaspore material was tested. The donor diaspore material, containing seeds, rhizomes, moss fragments, and other plant propagules, was collected from two different types of natural fens. We tested whether the application of straw mulch would increase fen species cover and biodiversity compared to control plots without straw mulch. Terrace levels of different peat depths (15 cm, 40 cm, and 56 cm) were created to test the effects of different environmental site conditions on the success of re-vegetation. Results: Applying donor seed bank from natural fens was found to significantly increase fen plant cover and richness after the two growing seasons. Straw mulch proved to significantly increase fen plant richness. The intermediate terrace level (40 cm) had the highest fen plant establishment. Compared to reference sites, the low terrace level (15 cm) was richer in base cations, whereas the high terrace level (56 cm) was much drier. Conclusions: The application of donor diaspore material was demonstrated as an effective technique for establishing vascular fen plants. Further re wetting measures are considered necessary at the restoration site to create a fen ecosystem rather than simply restoring some fen species.","2004","2025-03-13 14:18:01","2025-03-14 13:17:31","","209-220","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2.8","3","SC: 0000114","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This techniques applies a plant material transfer technique from fen donor sites to restore a post-extraction fen peatland in Québec. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; substrate disturbance; drawdown; rewetting; fen; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to understand the herbaceous dynamics following restoration, the bog was monitored prior to restoration and biannually over ten subsequent years, in two initial drainage conditions (dry peat fields and wet ditches), and compared to seven undisturbed bogs. Herbaceous community found prior to and in the early stage after restoration were characterized by species associated to mesic soil conditions with a fen-like pH, ruderal or wetland species, species with mycorrhiza or exotic species. These species did not persist in the latter stage after restoration and were replaced by species that are carnivorous, are associated to variable water availability and show mostly sexual reproduction. The extent of changes in traits composition of the herbaceous community between the early and latter stages after restoration showed the importance of multiple-year monitoring to evaluate restoration projects. The trait composition found in the latter stage after restoration appeared to converge toward the reference ecosystem where the community was characterized by species with large seeds, associated to humid soil conditions and a forest or peatland habitat. Lower trait diversity was found in the latter stage after restoration than in the reference ecosystem, especially in peat fields. In addition, species and functional diversity pattern varied with the initial drainage conditions, decreasing in peat fields while remaining stable in ditches. This suggests that different initial topography for restoration might help increase species and functional diversity of a managed ecosystem. Finally, our results outline measures to improve the moss layer transfer technique: sowing herbaceous species with large seeds in the latter stage after restoration, applying the restoration technique as soon as exploitation has terminated or removing all vegetation (including seeds and rhizomes) from the site to be restored.","2013-12","2025-03-13 14:18:01","2025-03-14 13:33:12","","519-526","","Part B","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.8","2","SC: 0000055","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines how herbaceous plant functional types change following the application of the moss layer transfer technique in post extraction peatlands. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; substrate disturbance; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; functional types; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 154 plant species and 36 bird species were recorded in the 16 peatlands studied (2-189 ha). Richness and frequency of ombrotrophic plant species were negatively associated with an increase in forest cover. Yet, minerotrophic and minerotrophic-ombrotrophic species did not appear to take advantage of this decline. Afforestation influenced bird species composition by altering the vegetation structure in all strata of the bogs (fewer mosses and shrubs, more trees) and by homogenizing the spatial distribution of plant communities (open patches progressively replaced by forested patches). Peatlands of southeastern Quebec remain islands of boreal vegetation in a matrix of deciduous forests and agricultural fields, but afforestation appears to progressively reduce the diversity of peatland habitats. Afforestation does not imperil plant or bird species across their entire range, but it contributes to impoverishing regional biodiversity.","2005","2025-03-13 14:18:01","2025-03-19 16:04:30","","161-171","","2","12","","Ecoscience","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000230239500002","","","SC: 0000075","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates the changes in plant and bird diversity and composition following the expansion of forests as a result of drainage of adjacent peatlands for peat extraction.</p> </div>","","","Canada; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; drawdown; bryophytes; sphagnum; migratory birds; mitigation hierarchy; fauna; woody plants; birds; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focussed our study on the monitoring of cotton-grass (Eriophorum vaginatum L.) tussocks. Major changes in the plant cover were observed during the five-year period, such as a decrease (26–31%) in the number of cotton-grass tussocks and an increase in the ericaceous shrub cover. The water table level (lower than 40 cm below the soil surface) and frost heaving appear to be the main factors explaining the failure of cotton-grass and of other typical bog plant species to colonize abandoned mined surfaces. The ericaceous shrub cover, although increasing, was still sparse even after two decades of abandonment, and it may take several additional decades before a complete shrub cover establishes itself. While the natural revegetation process of this vacuum-mined bog is still dynamic after two decades of abandonment, there is no evidence to suggest that vegetation assemblages will eventually resemble those of undisturbed peatlands.","2005","2025-03-13 14:18:01","2025-03-14 13:48:47","","612-633","","6","13","","Wetl.

Peatlands have suffered great losses following drainage for agriculture, forestry, urbanisation, or peat mining, near inhabited areas. We evaluated the faunal and vegetation patterns after restoration of a peatland formerly mined for peat. We assessed whether bog pools created during restoration are similar to natural bog pools in terms of water chemistry, vegetation structure and composition, as well as amphibian and arthropod occurrence patterns. 2. Both avian species richness and peatland vegetation cover at the site increased following restoration. Within bog pools, however, the vegetation composition differed between natural and man-made pools. The cover of low shrubs, Sphagnum moss, submerged, emergent and floating vegetation in man-made pools was lower than in natural pools, whereas pH was higher than in typical bog pools. Dominant plant species also differed between man-made and natural pools. 3. Amphibian tadpoles, juveniles and adults occurred more often in man-made pools than natural bog pools. Although some arthropods, including Coleoptera bog specialists, readily colonised the pools, their abundance was two to 26 times lower than in natural bog pools. Plant introduction in bog pools, at the stocking densities we applied, had no effect on the occurrence of most groups. 4. We conclude that our restoration efforts were partially successful.

Their establishment relies on consistent wet conditions and adequate nutrient supply. However, extreme climatic events, such as prolonged droughts, threaten Sphagnum establishment. To better understand the effects of water table fluctuations on the establishment of different Sphagnum species, we conducted a field experiment with stable and fluctuating water table conditions. After 1 year, we measured Sphagnum cover, lawn height (as a proxy for growth), carbon (C) accumulation, and nutrient stoichiometry of 12 species. Our results show that a stable water table facilitated Sphagnum growth during the establishment. Nitrogen (N) to potassium (K) and N to phosphorus (P) quotients were higher in the capitula biomass of Sphagnum in the fluctuating water table treatment. We identified two clusters of Sphagnum species: cluster 1, characterized by a low N:K quotient and higher C accumulation—indicating strong establishment potential—included Sphagnum palustre, S. fallax, S. fimbriatum, S. riparium, and S. denticulatum. In contrast, cluster 2 exhibited a higher N:K quotient and lower C accumulation—suggesting vulnerability to environmental changes during establishment—included S. fuscum, S. centrale, S. magellanicum, S. papillosum, S. rubellum, S. austinii, and S. squarrosum. Our results indicate that lawn species, particularly S. palustre, S. fallax, and S. denticulatum, are promising candidates for rapid Sphagnum establishment under wet and dry conditions.

Surface level changes of several centimeters a day were measured in the central portion of the fen, while the change was much less in the ridge and perimeter areas. Change in surface level at the perimeter and ridge sites was controlled by the depth of thaw. Levels of the central area were controlled by changes in water storage. A simple water balance model adequately predicted the lowering of the surface level of the central area of the fen. However, the same model underestimated rising surface levels. The adjusting surface level in the central area of the fen lead to a constantly saturated peat surface even during periods of persistent exfiltration.

A bog section of Bic-Saint-Fabien peatland near Rimouski, QC was vacuum-harvested for peat production and abandoned in 2000. Harvesting activity left topographic elevation differences across the harvested area, creating wetness gradients. In general, the site interior had more available water than peripheral regions. Bic-Saint-Fabien was cut down to minerotrophic sedge peat; therefore it was restored as a fen. Research for this study lasted four years, 2008–2011. A water budget was created for every year of study to determine the importance of different hydrological parameters at Bic-Saint-Fabien. The main loss of water was through evapotranspiration and the principal input was precipitation. The main difference in the water budget between study years was that pre-rewetting was climatologically wetter than post-rewetting. Despite more available water before rewetting, before-after-control-impact design ANOVA indicated the water table was significantly higher at the cutover area after rewetting. In 2011 a wetness gradient remained evident within the cutover section of the peatland; however the mean seasonal water table was close (within 20 cm) to the peat surface at all measured wells. An interior section of Bic-Saint-Fabien remained saturated for nearly all of 2011 and had mean seasonal water table of +2.4 cm, and volumetric soil moisture content and soil water pressure, measured 5 cm below the surface, of 86% and +4 mbar, respectively, compared to −15.4 cm, 67% and −13 mbar, respectively, at a nearby (∼100 m) peripheral section. Systematic differences in wetness across the site suggest that a uniform prescription for vegetation re-establishment in the rewetted section may not be appropriate.","2014-03","2025-03-13 15:07:49","2025-03-18 13:18:11","2025-03-13 15:07:49","151-160","","","64","","Ecological Engineering","Fen restoration on a bog harvested down to sedge peat","","","","","","","en","","","","","3.8","2","SC: 0000033","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper characterizes the hydrology of a post-extracted peatland with a fen substrate and shows that substantial variability in hydrological conditions exist after rewetting. </p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; substrate disturbance; water table; rewetting; fen; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This lack of understanding limits the ability to effectively conserve these systems and the ecosystem services they provide, including biodiversity and water provisioning. While fens tend to occur in clusters around regional groundwater mounds, Ives Road Fen in southern Michigan is an example of a geographically-isolated fen. In this paper, we apply a multi-scale groundwater modeling approach to understand the groundwater sources for Ives Road fen. We apply Transition Probability geo-statistics on more than 3000 well logs from a state-wide water well database to characterize the complex geology using conditional simulations. We subsequently implement a 3-dimensional reverse particle tracking to delineate groundwater contribution areas to the fen. The fen receives water from multiple sources: local recharge, regional recharge from an extensive till plain, a regional groundwater mound, and a nearby pond. The regional sources deliver water through a tortuous, 3-dimensional “pipeline” consisting of a confined aquifer lying beneath an extensive clay layer. Water in this pipeline reaches the fen by upwelling through openings in the clay layer. The pipeline connects the geographically-isolated fen to the same regional mound that provides water to other fen clusters in southern Michigan. The major implication of these findings is that fen conservation efforts must be expanded from focusing on individual fens and their immediate surroundings, to studying the much larger and inter-connected hydrologic network that sustains multiple fens.","2015-10-09","2025-03-13 15:14:05","2025-03-18 14:35:24","","e0140430","","10","10","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","3.7","3","SC: 0000013","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates how the groundwater of rich fens is affected by multiple aquifer sources to produce generally similar upwelling conditions. </p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; groundwater; fen","","Basu, Nandita B","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, the hydrologic systems that sustain fens are complex and not well understood. Traditional approaches for characterizing such systems use simplifying assumptions that cannot adequately capture the impact of variability in geology and topography. In this study, a hierarchical, multi‐scale groundwater modelling approach coupled with a geologic model is used to understand the hydrology of a fen in Michigan. This approach uses high‐resolution data to simulate the multi‐scale topographic and hydrologic framework and lithologic data from more than 8500 boreholes in a statewide water well database to capture the complex geology. A hierarchy of dynamically linked models is developed that simulates groundwater flow at all scales of interest and to delineate the areas that contribute groundwater to the fen. The results show the fen receiving groundwater from multiple sources: an adjacent wetland, local recharge, a nearby lake and a regional groundwater mound. Water from the regional mound flows to an intermediate source before reaching the fen, forming a ‘cascading’ connection, while other sources provide water through ‘direct’ connections. The regional mound is also the source of water to other fens, streams and lakes in this area, thus creating a large, interconnected hydrologic system that sustains the entire ecosystem.

Location: Abandoned peat meadows in the central part of The Netherlands. Methods: Comparison of species composition and species abundance of vegetation and seed banks of reference and rewetted peat meadows, using plant trait and seed bank analysis. Results: Vegetation of rewetted meadows shared on average only 27% of their species with the reference meadow, while this was 50% on average for species in the seed bank. Rewetted meadows had a lower total number of species and a lower number of wet grassland and fen species present in the vegetation, but had higher species richness per m2, although evenness was not affected. Rewetting increased the dominance of species of fertile and near neutral habitats, but did not result in an increase of species of wet or waterlogged habitats. Re-wetted meadows were dominated by species relying mainly on vegetative reproduction and species with a low average seed longevity compared to the reference meadow. Conclusion: Rewetting was not effective as a restoration measure to increase plant species diversity or the number of wet grassland and fen species in the vegetation. If no additional restoration management is applied, the seed bank will be depleted of seeds of species of wet grassland or fen habitats, further reducing the chances of successful vegetation restoration.","2007-12","2025-03-13 15:20:40","2025-03-18 12:47:50","2025-03-13 15:20:40","315-324","","3","10","","Applied Vegetation Science","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","2.8","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper shows that rewetting alone does not necessarily restore the diversity of peatland plants in rewetted peatlands.</p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; drawdown; rewetting; fen; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we provide long-term data showing a mismatch between actual emissions and default emission factors and revealing the temporal patterns of annual carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in a rewetted peatland site in northeastern Germany. We show that site-level annual emissions of carbon dioxide and methane approach the IPCC default emission factors and those suggested for the German national inventory report only between 13 to 16 years after rewetting. Over the entire study period, we observed a source-to-sink transition of annual carbon dioxide fluxes with a decreasing trend of −0.36 t CO2-C ha−1 yr−1 and a decrease in annual methane emissions of −23.6 kg CH4 ha−1 yr−1.

Peatland rewetting aims to restore biomass accumulation from peat-forming plants for climate change mitigation, biotope conservation and water purification purposes. Boreal spruce swamp forests in Europe have suffered heavily from drainage for forestry and are now a focus of restoration efforts. 2.  We measured Sphagnum height and biomass increment by allowing Sphagnum to grow through mesh nets located in nine undrained, nine drained and 18 rewetted boreal spruce swamp forests. 3. At the moss patch level, rewetting led to a recovery of Sphagnum growth: height increment and biomass increment at the rewetted sites (5·9 ± 0·7 cm year−1 and 147 ± 15 g m−2 year−1, mean ± SE) were similar to increment at the undrained sites (4·9 ± 0·5 cm year−1 and 128 ± 12 g m−2 year−1), while remnant patches of Sphagnum at the drained sites showed smaller increment (2·8 ± 0·8 cm year−1 and 76 ± 19 g m−2 year−1). Sphagnum in the ditches at the drained sites showed similar increment as the moss at the undrained and rewetted sites, while ditches at the rewetted sites had the greatest increment (8·7 ± 0·7 cm year−1 and 183 ± 16 g m−2 year−1). A higher water-table increased Sphagnum growth, and Sphagnum riparium grew more rapidly than the other species. 4. At the ecosystem level, where information on moss cover was utilized, rewetting had increased Sphagnum production to values close to the undrained sites. At the drained sites, biomass production was 8 ± 17 g (mean ± SE) m−2 year−1, at the rewetted sites 42 ± 15 g m−2 year−1 and at the undrained sites 66 ± 12 g m−2 year−1. Sphagnum cover was the most important variable that determined Sphagnum production in the ecosystem. 5. Synthesis and applications. Drained spruce swamp forests appear to be a suitable target for restoration as they respond readily to rather inexpensive rewetting. The result points out that even in boreal conditions, restoration results can be achieved in a time-scale of years rather than decades. At the ecosystem level, rewetting had resulted in a biomass gain of 34 g m−2 year−1 when compared to drained sites.","2015-10","2025-03-13 15:35:21","2025-03-18 12:54:22","2025-03-13 15:35:21","1355-1363","","5","52","","Journal of Applied Ecology","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","5.7","1","SC: 0000028","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that rewetting of drained boreal swamp peatlands effectively restores sphagnum production. </p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; drawdown; rewetting; carbon cycle; primary productivity; bryophytes; sphagnum; swamp; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","Müller, Jörg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the blanket bog location, the coefficient was 80.6% for the intact site, 63.0% for the afforested site and 71.6% for the oldest restoration site (17?years post-felling). Compared with intact bog, median peak storm discharge was significantly greater in the restoration sites for the raised bog location but not for the blanket bog location. Water-table peak lag times were greatest, and water-table depths deepest in the afforested sites and the most recent raised bog restoration site and least in the oldest blanket bog restoration site. The estimated contribution of overland flow in the afforested sites was 2.9% for the raised bog and 11.9% for the blanket bog, increasing to 8.7% and 32.2% at the oldest restoration sites for the raised bog and blanket bog, respectively.

The abundance of shrubs plays a major role in the soil water flux and availability at the site, impacting Sphagnum regeneration. From June 1 to August 22, 2007, field measurements indicate that transpiration represented the largest water loss from the shrubs at 1·7 mm day?1, comprising 142 mm (42%) of rainfall, compared to 93 mm of evaporation (28%) from bare soil. The rainfall interception from the canopy (62 mm) and litter (15 mm) accounted for 23% of seasonal rainfall. Thus after transpiration and interception losses are accounted for, only 115 mm of the 334 mm of rain (34%) remained available for other processes (recharge/soil evaporation). In the field, the litter layer prevented 17 mm from being lost over the summer as it reduced evaporation by 18%. Laboratory experiments using intact soil monoliths with and without shrubs and litter indicate that at depths below 10 cm the water content from the shrub monoliths decreased 27% versus 20% in the bare peat monoliths because of root water uptake. As a management prescription, raising the water table within 20 cm of the surface would provide water to the most active root uptake zones, reducing the need for extraction from the upper 10 cm of the peat. At this level sufficient water can be supplied to the surface through capillary rise, providing adequate water for the reestablishment/survival of Sphagnum.

The efficiency of an adapted version of the MLTT using fen plants for minerotrophic (fen) peatland restoration has shown mixed results, especially regarding the recovery of bryophytes. Additionally, due to differences in peat extraction histories, disturbances, restoration techniques, and desired ecological outcomes, European approaches cannot be directly applied to North American peatlands. It has been suggested that active rewetting alone could ensure fen plant regeneration post-restoration. As there is a growing interest in the minerotrophic peatland restoration, fen restoration methods after peat extraction needs to be refined, and the management process stands in need of new approaches. This study presents the first case of an ecosystem-scale fen restoration project in Canada at an industrial peat extraction site. It was restored in the province of Quebec in 2009, testing three different restoration approaches, including active rewetting only - REW, active rewetting, and peat profiling with vegetation removal - REW + PRO, and a combination of active rewetting, peat profiling with vegetation removal, plus mechanical reintroduction of fen plant material (MLTT) - REW + PRO + PLANT. This study aims to compare the pre- and post-restoration (13 years) plant communities using a BACI design (Before and After Control Impact). It focuses on the recovery of bryophyte carpets and evaluates the return of fen species as well as peatland generalists, marsh-swamps, and upland species. At the whole site level, the rewetting action had a prominent impact and major success in terms of an increase in the richness and frequency of peatland vascular plant species, but the recruitment of peatland bryophytes and particularly brown mosses was relatively much less successful. Active rewetting proved relatively practicable compared to the other two restoration methods, but to enhance its efficiency, it should not result in flooding, which could subsequently lead to helophytisation. The different vegetation outcomes of the restoration were influenced by governing factors such as processes associated with restoration methods (e.g., rewetting, pre-existing vegetation removal, and donor material reintroduction) and site-specific physio-chemical and environmental conditions. Our 13 years post-restoration surveys highlight that there are still large knowledge gaps and that increased, robust research into fen restoration is needed.","2025-02","2025-03-14 17:16:44","2025-10-02 14:15:19","","","","","212","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001398213000001","3.8","2","SC: 0000000","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This study examines the 13-year recovery of post-extraction fens following restoration using either (i) active rewetting only, (ii) active rewetting, peat profiling and vegetation removal or (iii) active rewetting, peat profiling and vegetation removal and moss layer transfer. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vascular plants; substrate disturbance; drawdown; rewetting; bryophytes; fen; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; graminoids; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; brown mosses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods A wet (high water table) and dry (low water table) area were identified at the site and plots with cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum) or bare peat were established in each area. Plant growth, peat and porewater dissolved C (DOC) and N (TDN), microbial biomass and the emissions of CO2 and CH4 were monitored at the plots throughout the growing season. Results The largest concentrations of DOC were measured in dry and bare sites. Lower E2:E3 ratios suggested a higher aromaticity of the DOC at these sites that were net sources of CO2 and CH4. The concentration of TDN was greater in plots with cottongrass and high water table, supporting a more abundant microbial biomass. Cottongrass dominated plots also had larger gas emissions as compared to bare plots even though they were net C sinks due to their high photosynthetic rates. Conclusion Maintaining a high water table is key to reducing peatland C losses. While vascular plant presence seems to prime the release of N and greenhouse gases, the inputs of C exceeded the losses and recovered the C sink function of the peatland ecosystem in the short term. Carbon inputs are maximized under high water table and plant presence.","2020-03","2025-03-14 17:16:44","2025-03-18 13:09:20","","299-313","","1-2","448","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4.9","2","SC: 0000017","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates how rewetting of post-extraction peatlands planted with vegetation can effectively lead to net carbon sequestration.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; greenhouse gases; nutrients; water table; rewetting; carbon cycle; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The seasonal expression of water arising from the compression of underlying organic deposits may provide a source of water. A bog near Rimouski, Quebec (Canada) was harvested using the vacuum extraction method and cut down to underlying sedge peat; restoration procedures were implemented in the autumn of 2009. The residual peat layer is 0.4-1 m thick, and overlies a 1-1.5 m thick gyttja deposit. Gyttja is a coprogenous lake bottom sediment on which peat sometimes forms. Little is known about the hydrophysical properties of gyttja and the implications it may have for peatland restoration. The upper 40 cm of gyttja had average bulk density 0.12 g cm(-3), particle density 1.57 g cm(-3) and porosity 92 %. The organic matter and fibre contents of the gyttja were > 45 %, and both decreased with depth. Oedometer test results showed 9 and 72 % strain at 3.5 and 200 kPa, respectively, demonstrating the potential for water release upon compression, which in the field is caused by water table lowering. However, during the year of measurement (2011) the changes in effective stress caused by water table lowering were < 1 kPa, corresponding to a water table decline of < 10 cm. Under these conditions the volumetric moisture content of the top 30 cm of gyttja decreased by only 0.4 % and we observed 0.5 cm of gyttja settlement; this represented 0.4 % and 1.7 % strain, respectively. On the basis of these strains, we conclude that the release of water due to the consolidation of gyttja in 2011 had little impact on rewetting of the overlying peat. However, it may be important under drier conditions with a larger seasonal water deficit, and may have been important prior to restoration when larger water table fluctuations were observed.","2017","2025-03-14 17:16:44","2025-03-18 13:12:54","","","","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000397047800005","1.2","4","SC: 0000012","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the hydrological properties of gyttja (lake sediments) following peat extraction and the effects of rewetting. </p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; substrate disturbance; water table; rewetting; sediment; fen; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; substrate; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Once contaminated, they remain mostly bare because of the combination of high salinity, low pH, high water table and low nutrient availability. The goal of this research was to investigate how plant colonisation at salt-contaminated bogs can be accelerated, in order to prevent erosion and fluvial export of the peat. At two seawater-contaminated bogs, we tested the application of rock phosphate and dolomitic lime in combination with five plant introduction treatments: transplantation of Carex paleacea; transplantation of Spartina pectinata; transfer of salt marsh diaspores in July; transfer of salt marsh diaspores in August; and no treatment (control). The effects of different doses of lime on the growth of C. paleacea and S. pectinata were also investigated in a greenhouse experiment. In the field, phosphorus fertilisation improved plant growth. Transplantation of C. paleacea resulted in the highest plant colonisation, whereas salt marsh diaspore transfer led to the highest species diversity. Lime applications did not improve plant establishment in either the field or the greenhouse. To promote revegetation of seawater-contaminated cutover bogs, adding P is an asset, Carex paleacea is a good species to transplant, and the transfer of salt marsh diaspores improves plant diversity.","2016","2025-03-14 17:16:44","2025-03-17 19:33:20","","","","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000388384500017","1.2","4","SC: 0000004","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that a mild phosphorus-rich fertilizer and the introduction of salt-marsh plants help restore post-extraction peatlands where salt-water intrusion has occurred. </p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; peat; nutrients; substrate disturbance; mitigation hierarchy; salinity; vegetation disturbance; substrate; fertility change/contamination; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This could be achieved with ecological indicators, if they can be easily and routinely measured and are representative of the complexity of the restored ecosystems. We used peatlands restored after horticultural peat extraction in eastern Canada to test a methodological approach that predicts restoration success early after restoration implementation. The goal of restoration of these extracted peatlands is to re-establish a moss carpet typically dominated by Sphagnum mosses, the main peat-accumulating plant group in these northern ecosystems. Vegetation in a total of 152 plots in 41 peatlands restored after peat extraction activities and distributed across a span of 600 km was monitored every 2 years since the third year after restoration. The plots were clustered in three restoration outcome categories: Sphagnum-dominated, bare peat-dominated and Polytrichum-dominated, according to their characteristic vegetation composition at the time of the latest survey for each plot (4-11 years since restoration). Second, vegetation composition in the same plots from the earliest survey, 3 years since restoration, and key environmental and management variables such as summer temperature, effectiveness of ditch blockage, season of restoration works and delay in P fertilization were analyzed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to obtain the combination of parameters that best discriminated between the restoration outcome categories. LDA correctly classified 71% of the plots of a calibration database (for which 75% of the sectors were used) and 75% of a validation database (for which 25% of the sectors were used) into the three categories. The obtained LDA models can be used to allocate new plots to one of the restoration outcome categories by providing a series of linear equations (classification functions) that are computed from the combination of ecological indicators. One additional and recently restored peatland was used to illustrate application of these equations of the LDA model to predict future restoration outcome and subsequently adapt management strategies. Such a LDA model provides an unequivocal (i.e., one new plot assigned to one and only one restoration outcome category) prediction of success based on multiple but simple, easily recognizable indicators and spares managers the complex task of interpreting many individual predictors for establishing a clear diagnosis.

We surveyed a total of 55 trenches in 6 peatlands twice, similar to 25 and similar to 35 years after the cessation of peat extraction. Canonical ordinations evidenced a generalized process of afforestation during the decade studied, partially driven by agricultural drainage in the surrounding landscape. Plant communities were dominated by ericaceous shrubs that hampered the spontaneous recovery of a Sphagnum-dominated system typical of bogs in the short and medium-term. Three of the six peatlands surveyed were partially restored by blocking drainage ditches. There, we surveyed plant composition in rewetted (28) and non-rewetted (26) trenches and observed that rewetting mitigated the increase in tree dominance, decreased the dominance by ericaceous shrubs, and favored the spread of non-vascular species with a wet habitat preference (notably Sphagnum species from the Cuspidata section).

However, the peaty margins of artificial pools are unstable, as frost heave creates much surface erosion restricting establishment of vascular plant seedlings. This study evaluates the ability of heather shrubs (Ericaceae) to stabilize created pool margins in restored peatlands. Andromeda polifolia var. latifolia and Vaccinium macrocarpon plants were introduced to form a sparse cover (<25%) at pool margins. Sphagnum mains fragments were spread simultaneously between the shrubs over half the surface at a density of 50% in ground cover, and seeds of herbaceous plants typical of pool margins were sown at two distances from the low-water mark (0.5 and 3.5 m). We examined the impact of Ericaceae on (1) frost heave intensity, (2) S. majus establishment and (3) herbaceous species establishment. Treatments using ericaceous shrubs or Sphagnum, both alone or in combination, all reduced frost heave by about 50%. After one year, it also increased survival of S. majus (four-fold) on the wettest soil along the banks. However, at a greater distance from the water (2 and 3.5 m), the Sphagnum cover was not influenced by the presence of Ericaceae. Establishment and growth of herbaceous plants grown from seeds were not influenced by the presence of Ericaceae. This study demonstrates the potential of Ericaceae for stabilizing the peat substrate close to the water line and improving survival of S. majus introduced at the immediate edge of created pools.","2013-11","2025-03-14 17:16:44","2025-03-18 12:20:25","","1-8","","","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000328099800002","1.8","3","SC: 0000009","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This study demonstrates that the planting of ericaceous shrubs around t he edges of pools facilitates the growth of Sphagnum, but not vascular plant seedlings.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; substrate disturbance; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; woody plants; graminoids; pools/ponds; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Decomposition and accumulation rates variations were hypothesized to lead to higher organic matter accumulation potential in the more complex micro-habitats. In general, for a given litter type, the mass losses and decomposition rates were rather homogeneous between micro-habitats, but, they were correlated to the cover of particular species: Eriophorum vaginatum with slower decomposition rates, and Ledum groendlandicum or Kalmia angustifolia with higher rates. Therefore, the abundance of some peatland species, rather than the habitat complexity itself, was a driver of decomposition rates. While the Sphagnum AGNPP did not compensate for decomposition losses, the organic matter accumulation potential was tipped towards a sink (positive) by the contribution of vascular species to the AGNPP. The organic matter accumulation potentials are much improved by the presence of Sphagnum, but from a restoration perspective, promoting the growth of vascular peatland species might also be a key to achieving a positive balance of organic matter accumulation.","2013-10","2025-03-14 17:16:44","2025-03-17 19:33:07","","811-821","","5","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000324107200004","2","4","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that vascular plants contribute more than bryophytes and Sphagnum to carbon sequestration in post-extraction peatland following their restoration using the MLTT method.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vascular plants; decomposition; substrate disturbance; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; primary productivity; active restoration; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about nutrient dynamics and microbial processes in this region. Belowground nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) transformations and carbon utilisation by microorganisms were examined in a harvested peatland 10 years after restoration measures were implemented to assess whether restoration is returning the peatland to a state that falls within the natural range of variation found in a neighbouring bog. N mineralisation rates were almost 10-fold higher in the surface (0-10 cm) compared to the subsurface (10-20 cm) layers for all sites and were highly variable within sites. P pools were small (<0.02 mu g g(-1) dry peat) and mineralisation rates of P were low in all sections. In the surface layer, the net mineralisation and ammonification rates appeared to be highest in unrestored sites but lowest in restored sites. In contrast, the capacity of microorganisms in using different carbon (C) sources, also described as microbial functional diversity, was highest at restored sites but lowest at unrestored sites. The preferable C sources varied between sites and were significantly correlated with aboveground vegetation composition. Our study suggests that microbial activity and nutrient transformations differ between natural and unrestored harvested peatlands. Our results indicate that the presence of vegetation regrowth in the unrestored area of a peatland alters belowground processes by stimulating microbial activity and increasing the uptake of nutrients, leading to smaller pools of inorganic N available in the peat. When restoration has been carried out, microbial activity is even higher than in natural conditions, possibly leading to high immobilization of N, and net mineralisation rates are very low. This research indicates that while belowground processes have shifted from unrestored conditions following restoration, they do not appear to be fully re-established to a degree similar to natural conditions 10 years post-restoration.","2013-09","2025-03-14 17:16:44","2025-03-17 18:59:43","","37-47","","","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000321679300006","9.7","1","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of post-extracted peatland restoration using MLTT after a decade on the nutrient dynamics and microbial communities.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; bog; microbial activity; nutrients; active restoration; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we propose the use of the Indicator Value Index technique (IndVal), which statistically determines the association of species to one or several particular site types, to obtain indicators of success at the early stages of the recovery process in restoration projects. Peat bogs extracted by the vacuum method, subsequently restored by a moss-transfer technique and regularly monitored for similar to 10 years were used as a model system to test this approach. We first identified 34 restored sectors of similar to 10 ha from 4 to II years old in twelve eastern-Canadian bogs. These sectors were then classified according to their degree of success in recovering a typical sphagnum moss carpet (restoration goal). Then, we retrospectively reviewed vegetation communities recorded at the third year after restoration to identify indicator species of different categories of restoration success, using the IndVal methodology. By identifying early indicator species, our method provides a tool that guides intervention soon after restoration if a site is not on a desired successional trajectory. Typical bog species, namely the bryophytes S. rubellum and Mylia anomala and the tree Picea mariana, were indicative of successful restoration; while bare peat, lichens and one species of ericaceous shrubs (Empetrum nigrum), which cope better under drier conditions, indicated sites where restoration failed. A surprising finding was that the moss Polytrichum strictum, which is known to facilitate the colonization of sphagnum in disturbed peatlands, is an early indicator of unsuccessful restoration. This finding made us question the nursing role of P. strictum at a cover threshold above ca. 30%, when P. strictum could be outcompeting sphagnum and become dominant. We conclude that the IndVal method is an effective tool to identify early indicators of restoration success when combined with a thoughtful examination of species frequency and cover within each site type.","2013-09","2025-03-14 17:16:45","2025-03-17 19:32:40","","232-238","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000319891900026","6.9","2","SC: 0000099","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates how specific indicator species can act to predict and hence monitor the success of restoration using the moss layer transfer technique after a decade. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; substrate disturbance; rewetting; monitoring; bryophytes; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; woody plants; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined the successional trajectories of vegetation within peatlands exploited by the traditional block-cut technique in Eastern Canada, with the final purpose of identifying sites which need human intervention to ensure the return of a typical Sphagnum-dominated bog community that accumulates C. Ordinations showed that the development of vegetation was different between three block-cut peatland regions. Peatlands of one of the regions were initially colonized by tall, dense ericaceous shrubs. There, communities tended to become increasingly dominated by trees and understories were closing over time, therefore not being on a trajectory toward the recovery of a Sphagnum-dominated system that accumulates peat in the future. Intervention is therefore recommended, for example by blocking still active drainage ditches.

How many years are required for plant species composition of re-vegetated cutover peatlands to resemble natural boreal bogs? Location Newly formed Sphagnum carpets on restored, cutover peatlands (in Canada) or re-vegetated spontaneously after site abandonment (in Estonia) and on undisturbed natural bogs nearby. Methods Plant frequencies (point intercept method) and abundances (vegetation quadrats) were assessed along linear transects. At each assessment point, moss surface height was measured relative to a local reference point (lowest point on a given transect) to associate frequencies or abundances to a position in the gradient of microtopography. PCAs (separately for Canada and Estonia) were conducted to follow evolution of plant species frequency in the gradient of microtopography in re-vegetated sites and similarity with those of natural peatlands. In Canada, regressions were also performed to estimate relationships between moss surface height and vascular plant cover (ericaceous shrubs and Cyperaceae) as well as time required for vascular plant cover to become similar to that of natural bogs. Results Species composition was still dissimilar to microstructures of natural bogs 10 yr post-restoration and 70 yr post-abandonment; however, some trends were observed in re-vegetated peatlands. The greatest differences were for ericaceous species (two- to three-fold less abundant in re-vegetated peatlands), dominant Cyperaceae, and relative proportions of Sphagnum. In addition, hummock formation was closely related to dense (>50%) ericaceous cover. Conclusions All species tolerant to abiotic conditions prevailing in re-vegetated sites contributed to initiation of microtopography, although some species were found in atypical positions within the gradient of microtopography. Random events and establishment priority seemed initially to be more important in temporal evolution of microstructures than plant interactions. However, ecological restoration could effectively reduced time needed for species occurrences to approach those in natural peatlands, relative to time required for recovery of spontaneously re-vegetated peat extraction sites.","2012-08","2025-03-14 17:16:45","2025-03-18 14:21:58","","369-382","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000305936800008","2.8","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the changes in vegetation along hummock to hollow sequences in the actively restored and passively restored post-extraction peatlands and finds that typical vegetation gradients are not yet established. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; substrate disturbance; bryophytes; sphagnum; microtopography; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; graminoids; physiography; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both temperature and substrate were significant for explaining variability in net DOC production rate in both short (5 days) and longer term (25 day) laboratory incubations. Moss (Sphagnum spp. and Polytricum spp.) produced the least amount of DOC, with initial release rates of 0.02-0.35 mg DOC g(-1) d(-1). Shrubs, and to a lesser extent herbaceous vegetation, showed an initial high release of DOC followed by a decrease. Peat from the restored site had significantly higher longer-term DOC production rates than the cutover site. Humic acid (HA) was more likely to be produced by shrub and herbaceous plant material than by peat, mosses and straw. The hydrophilic (HPI) fraction of the DOC increased at higher temperatures. Despite differences in the surface cover of available substrate (e.g. vascular vegetation, moss, and straw), there was no difference in the quality of DOC exported from the cutover and restored sites. However, hydrological and biogeochemical controls were apparent in temporal variability of DOC quality in discharge. DOC exported during snowmelt and most storm events was high in HPI with little contribution from HA. Since contact time between water and soil is limited during these high flow periods, larger more hydrophobic HA molecules are less likely to be mobilized. Higher export of HA in summer compared to spring and autumn suggests that polycondensation and increased vascular plant productivity are important for controlling seasonal patterns of DOC export quality. As various substrates produced different amounts and quality of DOC, it is likely that the DOC quality exported from the restored site will continue to change as the new vegetation community develops. DOC production rates and DOC quality should be considered when developing a plan to control DOC runoff/export from managed peatlands.","2011-12","2025-03-14 17:16:45","2025-03-18 14:55:39","","1998-2008","","12","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000296930100007","3.8","2","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper uses a laboratory study and a field study to demonstrate how DOC is produced and exported in extracted peatlands versus rewetted and revegetated peatlands. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; substrate disturbance; rewetting; carbon cycle; dissolved organic carbon; mitigation hierarchy; surface water/runoff; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, when peatlands are exploited for Sphagnum moss and horticultural peat, they become degraded and large, persistent sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Recent advances in peatland restoration techniques have succeeded in the re-vegetation of Sphagnum moss on previously cutover surfaces. The long-term success of peatland restoration depends on the development of a sufficiently thick new peat layer that has ecohydrological and hydrophysical properties similar to natural peatlands. We determined these properties for an upper (0-4 cm) and lower (8-12 cm) peat layer in a recently restored peatland, a naturally re-vegetated cutover peatland, and a natural peatland in eastern Quebec. The properties of the new peat layer differed significantly between the sites, especially for the lower layer samples. Lower samples for the natural and naturally re-vegetated sites had a bulk density of 43 +/- 5 and 41 +/- 11 kg m(-3), respectively, almost twice as high as the value for lower samples from the restored site (24 +/- 4 kg m(-3)). Sphagnum rubellum capitula density (rho(c)) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) for the restored peatland (28 726 # m(-2)) compared to the natural site (26 050 # m(-2)). Residual moisture content at a soil water pressure of -200 tub (theta(r)) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) for the restored site in comparison to the natural and naturally re-vegetated sites for the lower samples. This suggests that S. rubellum in a natural peatland is able to hold onto more moisture under increasing soil tension than the same species growing in a restored site likely due to its higher bulk density and relatively more decomposed state. We suggest that it is possible that S. rubellum growing in the harsher cutover peatland environment has possibly allocated more carbohydrates to vertical growth and as a consequence has a lower bulk density and poorer water retention.","2011-05","2025-03-14 17:16:45","2025-03-18 15:03:26","","359-366","","3","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000291524400002","2.6","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper compares the moisture relations in sphagnum mosses in recently restored, a naturally recolonized and a natural peatland in eastern Quebec. </p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; substrate disturbance; soil moisture; bryophytes; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Location: Newly formed Sphagnum carpets on cutover peatlands that revegetated spontaneously after site abandonment (in Estonia), or following active restoration (in Canada) and on undisturbed natural bogs nearby. Methods: Moss surface height was measured along linear transects above a local reference level (the lowest point for a given transect). Heights of at least 20 cm were associated with hummocks. Frequency distributions of surface height and principal component analyses (separately for Canada and Estonia) were conducted to follow the evolution of microtopography in revegetated sites and their similarity with those of natural peatlands. In Canada, regressions were also performed to estimate the time required for the microtopography in revegetated cutover peatlands to become similar to that found in natural bogs. Results: Only 10-30 yr were needed for microstructures comparable to those in natural bogs to develop on restored peatlands where Sphagnum diaspores have been reintroduced. However, this process may take more than a century in cutover peatlands left to revegetate spontaneously. Conclusions: In cutover peatlands with spontaneous revegetation, hummock-hollow formation starts on bare peat which lacks both plant propagules and viable seed banks, and the initiation of microstructures is probably more akin to the process that occurs naturally. Nonetheless, hummock-hollow microtopography resembling that found in natural bogs without pools appeared, in all of the examined cutover peatlands, over periods that are short in terms of peatland development time-scales. Active peatland restoration could effectively reduce the time required for initiation of microtopography by about 70 yr.","2011-04","2025-03-14 17:16:45","2025-03-18 14:16:35","","158-171","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000287863600002","2.8","3","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that the passive restoration of hummocks and hollow topography in post-extraction peatlands can occur but that that active restoration will speed up this process dramatically.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; substrate disturbance; bryophytes; sphagnum; active restoration; microtopography; passive restoration; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; physiography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested three fragment sizes (patches of 2 cm(2), stretched patches and shredded fine fragments of 0.1-1 mm), two introduction densities (ratio between surface of collected areas and surface of restored areas of 1:5 and 1:10) as well as the effect of a straw mulch. After two years, the percentage covers of C. fluitans were five times larger in experimental units protected with straw than in those without protection. Yet, the fragment sizes and the densities tested had no effect on the regeneration of the liverwort.

Our results indicate that the PLFA profiles were different between the beginning and the end of the growing season, but that it was impossible to distinguish five different vegetation classes found along the disturbance-recovery gradient on the basis of the microbial community structure. The pH, the cover of mosses, Ledum groenlandicum and Erlophorum vaginatum var. spissum were the best environmental predictors for the PLFA composition. The newly formed peat found in aerobic conditions beneath restored Sphagnum carpets had the highest decomposition capacity, whereas the lowest rates were found in the surface samples of non-restored conditions or in the deepest horizons of the natural samples. A large proportion of the variation in the physiological profiles was explained with variables related to the vegetation cover, the physicochemical environment and the microbial structure of the community, which is very promising for future monitoring studies.

The aim of the study was to identify abiotic stresses impeding plant establishment and test transplanting of salt-tolerant wetland plants. The site consisted of long cambered rectangular fields that sloped down (2%) to the drainage ditches on both sides. Across this slope, zones were delineated based on moisture gradient as: Up-areas (drier), Mid-areas (moist) and Low-areas (wet). Juncus balticus was transplanted to these zones in August 2004 whereas Spartina pectinata was reintroduced in June 2005. Plant material was collected from nearby marshes. Survival of J. balticus in August 2005 was poorest at the Low-areas probably because of the early season flooded conditions of that zone. S. pectinata survival in June 2006 was good in all zones having better adaptation to early season waterlogged conditions. Early season waterlogged conditions resulted from a perched water table (May-June) and were alleviated only upon the complete thaw of the frozen peat layer on 8 July. Thereafter, important changes in peat characteristics occurred: lowered water table depths that increased redox potentials, decreased moisture content (theta) that increased dry bulk density (rho), and increased electrical conductivity (EC) that decreased pH. Waterlogged conditions were of greater magnitude and duration at the Low-areas but salinity levels were highest in the Up-areas and Mid-areas. We conclude that local conditions of waterlogging (especially in the Low-areas) and high salinity and low pH (notably in the Up- and Mid-areas) favoured the survival of S. pectinata in all areas and J. balticus in Up- and Mid-areas only.","2008-04","2025-03-14 17:16:45","2025-03-18 13:47:47","","333-342","","3","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000254777900016","5.7","2","SC: 0000060","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper tests restoration techniques for post-peat extraction sites flooded by sea water.

In southern Quebec (Bas-Saint-Laurent, Canada), peatlands are extensively mined to extract peat for the production of horticultural compost and are isolated within agricultural lands. Government environmental agencies have proposed that peat industries set aside 5-10% of a bog's area as a natural refuge for peatland plants and animals. Do these fragments constitute reliable refuges? Do they maintain their ecological characteristics over a long period? We studied the recent evolution of plant communities in peatland fragments using paleoecological techniques and a geographical information system. In the study area, some treeless fragments dominated by Sphagnum species have recently (since 1940) converted to forest sites. Macrofossil and dendrochronological analyses suggest that peat-mining activities were not the main factors responsible for the afforestation of peatland fragments. On the other hand, the isolation of the Bas-Saint-Laurent peatlands within an agricultural plain for more than 100 years may explain the afforestation process (drainage activities). Furthermore, fires may have accelerated afforestation by facilitating the spread of seeds of tree species with serotinous cones. Because most peatlands of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region are still affected by drainage and fires, it is probable that several open bog fragments will not maintain their treeless vegetation structure over a long period. Consequently, peatland fragments should not be considered as a solution to long-term conservation needs in southern Quebec, at least not for plant and animal species of open bogs.

Unfortunately, in the recent past, considerable changes such as drainage and peat extraction due to anthropogenic activities have been impacting peatlands. These land conversions disturbed the functioning of peatlands by increasing organic matter decomposition: hence converting long-term C sink to atmospheric C source. Previously, ecological engineering tools such as rewetting was used to reverse hydro-physical properties of peatlands that can limit C emissions and provides better substrate conditions conducive to Sphagnum farming. Also, another tool could be phenolic addition as trialed at lab-based level to test the enzymic latch mechanism (ELM) but reports from the literature reveal contradictory results. Therefore, this dissertation aimed to assess the role of rewetting (blocking former ditches with dams) or enhanced rewetting (by an irrigation system through channels) with phenolic additions on strengthening of the ELM. More specifically, to test how ELM can limit peat decomposition in two experimental models such as post-extracted unrestored peatlands and Sphagnum farming system in Québec, Canada. This thesis is therefore divided into three sub-objectives: the first one focused on post-extracted unrestored peatlands and the other two sub-objectives were focused on Sphagnum farming system. Material and methods: For the first sub-objective related to management of post-extracted peat fields, an experiment involving rewetting along with three distinct phenolic treatments was conducted on two post-extracted unrestored (UNR) sectors (young and old) that differed in age (UNR-1 yr and UNR-41 yr) since the horticultural peat extracting activities ceased. For the second sub-objective aiming to improve Sphagnum culture, an experiment with the addition of three phenolic treatments was established in two cultivation basins dominated by the Acutifolia or Sphagnum subgenus species in a Sphagnum farming syste. For the third sub-objective, an experiment with three phenolic treatments was conducted on two developmental stages — 1 yr-established carpet and 9 yr-established carpet — with Sphagnum species of the Acutifolia subgenus. The developmental stages refer to the cultivation age of carpets composed of Acutifolia subgenus species in a Sphagnum farming system. The phenolic treatments were: Picea mariana aboveground fresh wood chips (used only in the first sub-objective) or wood pellets (wood), old roots from peat harrowing (root), and a subplot with no additions (control). The effectiveness of treatments was assessed mainly by carbon dioxide exchange, peat soluble phenolics and extracellular enzyme activities. Sphagnum productivity (for the second sub-objective) and biomass accumulation (for the second and third sub-objectives) were also accounted.  Results: In the case of first sub-objective, water table level at UNR-1 yr sector was slightly increased as a result of rewetting (-48 cm) compared to non-rewetted (-57 cm) plots. Largely, carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions, phenol oxidase, and hydrolase enzyme activities at both UNR sectors were not inhibited in response to rewetting and phenolic additions. As for second sub-objective, phenolic additions showed higher CO2 values (more CO 2 release compared to CO2 uptake) as net ecosystem exchange compared to control for both Acutifolia and Sphagnum subgenus carpets. Phenolic additions were unable to induce positive effect on peat soluble phenolics, productivity, and biomass accumulation within both subgenera Sphagnum carpets. Enzyme activities were not limited in response to phenolic additions also for both subgenera Sphagnum carpets. For the third sub-objective, phenolic additions were unable to limit CO 2 emissions and enzyme activities at both developmental stages of Acutifolia subgenus Sphagnum carpets. Conclusion: The results of the three experimental approaches showed little support in the strengthening of ELM in response to rewetting and phenolic treatments. Specifically for the first sub-objective, we assumed that oxic conditions due to still low water table level (< -45 cm) did not create enzymic latch, which is required for strengthening of ELM. Overall, for all sub-objectives, another reason for failure in detecting ELM could be absence of inhibitory effects of phenolic additions on enzyme activities. We also assumed that higher CO 2 emissions detected in this study might be linked with the decomposition of phenolic products themselves. Though ELM in response to rewetting and phenolic additions on these short-term field experiments is not validated, this study has contributed to greater understanding of the ELM in response to field phenolic additions. Still, further research is warranted to compare environmental variables between the top surface and vertical peat profile depth to better understand rewetting and phenolic addition effects on peat decomposition processes. Also, additional investigations are required to identify phenolic products that could limit peat decomposition.","2025","2025-03-18 15:07:28","2025-03-18 15:24:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université Laval","Québec","","","PhD","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis tests the enzyme latch theory and examines whether of adding materials with high phenolics to post-peat extraction sites slows decomposition and increases sphagnum carbon sequestration.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; on-site restoration; decomposition; greenhouse gases; peat; substrate disturbance; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; primary productivity; bryophytes; sphagnum; mitigation hierarchy; substrate; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly the case for Sphagnum-dominated peatlands restored using the Moss Layer Transfer Technique (MLTT) after mechanical peat extraction for horticulture. These ecosystems are the focus of the present study, where the species pools of bryophytes and lichens were initially compared between 41 pairs of natural donor sites and restored peatland sectors. The proportion of transferred bryophyte species successfully re-establishing after restoration (transfer rate) was determined to be 69 ± 2% (13 out of 18 reintroduced bryophytes). Only four species were identified as recalcitrant—present in donor sites but absent in restored sectors: Calypogeia neesiana, C. sphagnicola, Ptilidium ciliare, and Sphagnum quinquefarium. However, the bryophyte and lichen flora of the donor peatlands was less diverse than that of the restored peatlands, where bryophyte richness decreased over the post-restoration years. Following MLTT application, there was expansion of regenerating Sphagnum cover and revegetation of disturbed substrates (e.g., bare peat, frost heaving, straw, litter). This led to the progressive disappearance of spontaneously established bryophytes, which are absent from the transferred material and often represent early successional species. As a result, the bryophyte communities of MLTT-restored peatlands evolved towards those typical of their natural counterparts, namely ""open bog"" type peatlands. The restoration method thus facilitates the recovery of typical bryophyte diversity in Sphagnumdominated peatlands, as the recalcitrant bryophytes are mostly associated with shaded conditions that may not be available between 6- and 26-years post-restoration. Considering that the targeted reference ecosystem for restoration is ultimately the ""open bog,"" no intervention other than allowing more time to elapse since restoration is suggested to promote the recovery of the four recalcitrant species.","2023","2025-03-18 15:20:51","2025-03-18 16:30:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université Laval","Québec","","","MSc","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis examines the efficiency of transfer of bryophyte species from donor sites to post-extraction peatlands following their restoration using the MLTT method. </p> </div>","","","Canada; on-site restoration; vegetation; substrate disturbance; bryophytes; sphagnum; active restoration; donor site; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Major changes can occur to the hydrology and internal processes within a peatland during the transition to a drained, extracted, peat field that can influence the availability and export of nutrients. In addition to changes occurring within the harvested field, drainage ditch composition and beaver (Castor canadensis) dams can further modify the water quality exported to downstream ecosystems. The objective of this study was to investigate changes to the in-field processes and hydrological connectivity that may influence the outflow water quality during the understudied period when a peatland is opened and initially extracted in the continental Boreal Forest in Alberta, Canada. Water levels, volumetric flow, depth of ice, and aeration depth were measured along with water chemistry (electrical conductivity (EC), major ions, pH, and nutrients (dissolved and particulate nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C))) in surface water and groundwater in natural and harvested peat fields, and at the outflows of the peatland complex. Sampling was initiated in the fall of 2018, prior to peatland disturbance, and continued monthly from March through October in 2019 and 2021, capturing the perimeter ditching, vegetation mulching, internal ditching, and peat extraction. In situ ion availability was measured in surface peat layers, alongside surface and below ground temperature, soil moisture, and peat aeration in 2021. Perimeter ditching had little impact on the peat field hydrology; however, ditching increased the catchment contributing area and magnitude of flow to the outflow and extended the flow duration throughout the year compared to the reference. Mulching the vegetation increased water levels, surface temperatures, and initial concentrations of total dissolved N and P in porewaters within the harvested peat field, although N and P concentrations were not sustained at peak levels. Internal ditching and ongoing extraction decreased water levels below 100 cm, but soil moisture remained high and aeration was shallow. Nutrient concentrations in the harvested field were elevated relative to the reference, likely due to decomposition. Internal ditches did not consistently mirror the harvested field; higher nutrient concentrations were common and water was sourced from precipitation, surface, and deep peat porewaters in variable proportions throughout the year. Compared to natural peatland areas, harvesting activities greatly decreased peat water storage capacity, encouraged ice formation, and increased spring runoff in a landscape dominated by summer runoff. Transport of high stores of nutrients in the harvested field and internal ditches was dependent on hydrological connectivity that varied both seasonally and interannually. Thus, nutrient concentrations were often poor indicators of mass discharge and leaching risk. When ditches reached underlying mineral sediments, EC, pH, and P concentrations in outflow waters differed drastically relative to reference and harvested peatland porewaters, and drainage ditches acted as a source of predominantly mineral sediments. Waters exiting the main outflow ditch into the downstream outflow swamp had higher P and TSS concentrations, but similar N and DOC concentrations relative to an adjacent reference outflow swamp. Increased flow encouraged beavers to establish a dam at the harvesting operation outflow. Downstream of the beaver dam, ammonium and dissolved P concentrations rose above peat field outflow levels, but sediment concentrations were reduced. Although internal processes increased nutrient availability in the harvested fields, this study shows that hydrological connectivity, ditch substrate, and presence of beaver are key players governing the water quality exported downstream.","2024","2025-03-18 15:28:30","2025-03-18 15:36:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Alberta","Edmonton","","","MSc","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis examines the changes in water quality in water courses following the opening of peat fields for peat extraction.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; peat; nutrients; substrate disturbance; pH; drawdown; water quality; nutrient enrichment; electrical conductivity; dissolved organic carbon; suspended solids; beaver; ditching; substrate; fertility change/contamination; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These linear disturbances result in the degradation and fragmentation of habitats, and the alteration of the physicochemical properties and the water processes of peatlands. This project assesses the restoration of a peatland disturbed by an access road at an oil sands extraction site near Fort McMurray. The peatland restoration involved partially removing the mineral material from the road, adding a thin layer of peat (20 and 50 cm) or a thick peat layer (75 cm), spreading diaspores on the restored site, protecting the diaspores with straw, and fertilizing half of the restored site. Restoration occurred in two periods and two donor sites were used for diaspore collection. The objectives of this research are to assess the impact of the added organic substrate (peat) and of the fertilization on physicochemical properties of the substrate and therefore what does and does not influence the establishment of plant communities. Physicochemical measurements were taken one growing season following restoration. Vegetation inventories were conducted two growing seasons after restoration. After two growing seasons following restoration, fertilization had no impact on plant establishment. Results showed that two plant communities were present on the restored site. Two growing seasons following the restoration, the restored section with the greatest peat thickness (75 cm) had a greater number of species and a greater cover of plant and moss species typical of peat bogs. We conclude that the differences between restoration techniques between the two restored sections might explain the differences between the two communities that established at the restored site.","2022","2025-03-18 15:39:28","2025-03-18 15:45:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université Laval","Québec","","","MSc","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis examines the restoration of roads back to peatlands in Alberta.

However, over the past 30 years, many peatlands have been restored and open-water pools have been incorporated in some cases. Pools are naturally present in some bogs, especially in coastal and maritime regions, and are generally net C emitters, unlike peatlands. Pools are known to be micro-habitats with great potential for biodiversity and play a very important role for many species. In general, the measurement of the success of pool creation focuses on the return of bog plant species and a constant presence of water throughout the year. Currently, very few studies focus on the biogeochemistry of created pools to assess success. My research project uses biogeochemical variables to evaluate the success of created pools in peatland restoration projects. The research aims to identify biogeochemical differences between created and natural pools and to determine the biogeochemical trajectory of created pools over time. We measured different biogeochemical variables such as pH, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), base cations - calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) and dissolved gases - methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) -. Sampling was done in 62 pools located in 7 peatlands in Quebec and New Brunswick. We sampled both natural pools and pools created between 3 and 22 years ago. Natural and created pools have different biogeochemical characteristics, without considering the year of creation. Water in created pools is less acidic (pH >5) and more concentrated in nutrients - N and P - than in natural pools. However, the oldest created pools tend to be closer to the biogeochemical characteristics of natural pools. The variation of the water table and the depth of the pools play an important role for the return towards natural biogeochemical characteristics. Deeper and larger created pools could allow a permanent water presence during dry periods in summer and thus promote the return of biogeochemical conditions similar to natural pools.","2023","2025-03-18 15:48:41","2025-11-18 19:06:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université de Montréal","Montreal","","","MSc","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis examines the biogeochemistry, including nutrients, cations pH and GHGs of created pools in post-extraction peatlands versus natural pools in natural bogs.

Integrating this concept during the restoration of extracted peatlands and their natural surrounding is not common practise, in part to not being well understood. This thesis investigates the fundamental characteristics of the transition (ecotone) between natural bogs to fens and discusses various experimental management approaches that are used to restore transitions that have been compromised due to peat extraction. Data were collected from 5 transects from two (South Julius and Moss Spur 1) naturally undisturbed peatland sites and 8 identified transects from one (Moss Spur 2) disturbed peatland site in southeastern Manitoba. Each transect comprised 6 to 7 wells and 2 to 3 piezometer nests. These instrumentations allowed for the measurement of water table position, hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradients. Peat depths and surface elevation were determined for each transect at all sites while pH and electrical conductivity were measured at the undisturbed sites. At the disturbed site, water retention strategies were included to improve understanding of hydrological feedback across four experimental designs (5-Pond, 3-Pond, Berm and Control) at three sections (W-ECO, NW-ECO and S-ECO). Water tables were nearer to the ground surface in undisturbed areas compared to disturbed areas. The experimental management approach (after recontouring) applied at the disturbed site improved water table conditions especially on the 5-Pond treatment. Improved water table conditions coupled with improved flow rates may be vital for the transport of nutrient, water, and energy across the ecotone. Such improved conditions are important for the establishment of fen ecosystems.","2023","2025-03-18 15:59:48","2025-03-18 16:35:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brandon University","Brandon, MB","","","MSc","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis characterizes the biogeochemistry of bog to fen transitions in post-extraction peatlands before and after peatland rewetting. &nbsp;</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; bog; pH; water table; drawdown; rewetting; electrical conductivity; fen; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peatland disturbance, following land use changes or peat extraction, is also a source of GHG emissions. Thus, restoring the natural functions of peatlands, following peat exploitation, can significantly reduce emissions, restore the carbon sequestration function and preserve the remaining carbon stock in the peatland. The study site is one of the largest peatland complexes in Quebec in the Rivière-du-Loup region. The objective of this study was to estimate greenhouse gas emissions related to the decomposition of peat organic matter, which are estimated in CO2, CH4 and N2O, for the year 2022. The estimate was made using a greenhouse gas emissions calculator for the horticultural peat production industry. The data required to estimate GHG emissions and carbon sequestration were the land area and the number of years following development of various sectors of the peatland. In 2022, emissions from the 301-hectare peatland were approximately 2,500 tonnes of CO2 (t CO2) and 225 tonnes of CH4 equivalent (t CO2 eq). The main sources of carbon dioxide came from development during the harvesting and drainage phases. The types of development that emitted the most methane per year were natural (123 t CO2 eq), harvesting (49 t CO2 eq), and rewetting (29 t CO2 eq). The management plan implemented by the company aims to limit periods of deep drainage as much as possible by providing a restoration plan for each harvesting site to facilitate the return of a wetland ecosystem. The study's objective was to better understand emissions from the peatland area in order to identify potential avenues for GHG reduction.","2023","2025-03-18 16:08:33","2025-03-18 16:18:16","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université Laval","","","","MSc","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis attempts to understand GHG from peat extraction fields to identify potential avenues for GHG reduction.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; greenhouse gases; peat; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; impact minimization; mitigation hierarchy; substrate; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These roads are often built on peatland, a type of wetland characterized by its accumulation of peat. Roads can have several impacts on the environment, such as the nutrient enrichment of the nearby peatland and the disruption of the water flow. A new reclamation approach was tested on a bog disturbed by a road used for oil sands extraction in the Fort McMurray region, in Alberta. This new approach consists in the partial extraction of the road mineral substrate (in order to rewet the road), the application of the Moss Layer Transfer Technique directly on the residual mineral substrate, and the creation of channels to induce a better water flow at the water table level through the road. The success of the restoration technique is assessed on the basis of four objectives: 1) restoring the homogeneity of the water table on both sides of the road; 2) establishing surface conditions favorable to the target plant communities; 3) mitigating the impact of the road on the physicochemical conditions of the adjacent peatland; 4) restoring plant communities typical of the region's peatlands. The results of this study show that the restoration technique used makes it possible to induce better water flow and surface conditions favorable for the targeted species. However, despite these improvements, the road continues to have a dam effect on the water flow coming from the adjacent peatland. Additionally, an enrichment effect for several chemical elements and components up to a distance of 2 m from the road have been measured in the peatland. As this project is one of the first of its kind to apply the Moss Layer Transfer Technique directly on mineral substrate of a road, a greenhouse experiment was carried out to determine which Sphagnum and other moss species are best suited for the colonization of mineral substrate in northern Alberta. The survival of seven bryophyte species was assessed over a four-month period based on the presence or absence of shading. Further greenhouse experiments will be needed to corroborate these results, to study a greater number of moss species and thus determine which taxa are more apt to colonize a mineral substrate. Although more research is needed, the knowledge acquired during this study will allow industry, government and other organizations working in wetlands to continue to develop promising wetland restoration techniques on mineral substrate and thus promote a more sustainable development by reducing their ecological footprint.","2022","2025-03-18 16:18:56","2025-03-18 16:27:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université Laval","Québec","","","MSc","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis examines whether the moss layer transfer technique could be applied directly aggregate material of roads if the aggregate above the surrounding peatland grade is first removed. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; on-site restoration; substrate disturbance; sphagnum; roads; mitigation hierarchy; substrate rehabilitation; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The studies on abandonment, restoration, and creation of water bodies have focused mostly on analyzing vegetation and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, while the studies assessing afforestation and cultivation sites mostly evaluate the provisioning ecosystem services. The studies show that active restoration measures speed-up vegetation recolonization on bare peat areas, reduce GHG emissions and decrease negative impacts on water systems. The most notable research gap is the lack of studies comparing the environmental and social impacts of the after-use options. Additionally, there is a lack of studies focusing on social impacts and downstream hydrology, as well as long-term monitoring of GHG fluxes.

How the priming effect depends on depth is a critical question in drained peatland given the heterogeneity of soil layers defined by the water table, which include the surface acrotelm, inter-mesotelm and deep catotelm. Here, through incubation, we quantified the response of these three soil layers to addition of 13C-labeled oxalate, glucose, cellulose, or cinnamic acid under anoxic or oxic conditions on the Zoige Plateau in Tibet. Soil carbon in the inter-mesotelm showed the greatest decomposition, with the highest humification index and lowest microbial biomass carbon, while the soil carbon at the surface acrotelm was least decomposed. Under anoxic conditions, exogenous carbon addition reduced CO2 emission by 12.2% at the surface acrotelm but increased by 59.8% in the inter-mesotelm and 23.5% in the deep catotelm. In the inter-mesotelm, oxalate addition significantly increased CO2 emission by 63.9%, while cinnamic acid significantly increased it by 92.9%. In the deep catotelm, cinnamic acid significantly increased CO2 emission by 55.3%. These results suggested that deeper soil organic carbon was more sensitive to plant carbon, particularly complex or recalcitrant carbon, than surface acrotelm soil. Under oxic conditions, carbon addition increased surface soil CO2 emission by 18.9%, and triggered even greater increase at inter-mesotelm and deep catotelm soil, with proportions of 48.3% and 32.0%, respectively. Under both conditions, peat profile CO2 release increased by 17.2–31.4% after exogenous carbon addition, and more than 77.8% of the increase came from the deeper two layers. These findings highlighted the need to take full account of priming effect of deeper soil in order to assess and predict the stability of carbon stocks in drained peatland.","2022-11","2025-03-19 13:54:49","2025-03-19 20:31:23","2025-03-19 13:54:49","157539","","","848","","Science of The Total Environment","Carbon stock stability in drained peatland after simulated plant carbon addition","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that drainage effects will have stronger impacts on deeper soil layers because of the addition of simple carbon compounds from plant roots, known as the priming effect. </p> </div>","","","peatland; decomposition; peat; microbial activity; drawdown; carbon cycle; substrate; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vegetation biomass and biomass-C sequestration were also measured in both areas. The loss of total soil carbon accumulation due to drainage was 7.5 kg m−2 (− 25%), equivalent to a complete consumption of carbon accumulated for nearly 170 years in the near-pristine area. Vegetation succession after drainage had a little positive effect on ecosystem carbon sequestration, with an increase of 0.26 kg m−2, which compensated for only 3.5% of the peat soil carbon loss. Notably, over 80% of the total carbon loss after drainage was attributed to the loss of the recalcitrant carbon fraction.

We profiled the soil fungal community and estimated its genetic potential for the decay of lignin and phenolics (class II peroxidase potential) along peatland drainage gradients stretching from interior locations (undrained, open) to ditched locations (drained, forested). Mycorrhizal fungi dominated the community across the gradients. When moving towards ditches, the dominant type of mycorrhizal association abruptly shifted from ericoid mycorrhiza to ectomycorrhiza at c. 120 m from the ditches. This distance corresponded with increased peat loss, from which more than half may be attributed to oxidation. The ectomycorrhizal genus Cortinarius dominated at the drained end of the gradients and its relatively higher genetic potential to produce class II peroxidases (together with Mycena) was positively associated with peat humification and negatively with carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. Our study is consistent with a plant–soil feedback mechanism, driven by a shift in the mycorrhizal type of vegetation, that potentially mediates changes in aerobic decomposition during postdrainage succession. Such feedback may have long-term legacy effects upon postdrainage restoration efforts and implication for tree encroachment onto carbon-rich soils globally.","2023-10","2025-03-19 13:54:27","2025-11-18 20:15:57","2025-03-19 13:54:27","412-425","","1","240","","New Phytologist","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the fungal communities in peatlands as it relates to ditching and consequent water table drawdown.</p> </div>","","","peatland; vegetation; decomposition; peat; substrate disturbance; drawdown; carbon cycle; ditching; woody plants; substrate; hydrological alteration; drainage; ectomycorrhizal fungi; ericoid mycorrhizal fungi; mycorrhizal type; plant-mycorrhizal associations; vegetation gradient","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Boreal peatbogs are waterlogged systems that store more than 30% of the global soil carbon. Facilitative effects of shrubs and trees on the establishment of new individuals could increase tree cover with profound consequences for the structure and functioning of boreal peatbogs, carbon sequestration and climate. We conducted two field experiments in boreal peatbogs to assess the mechanisms that explain tree seedling recruitment and to estimate the strength of positive feedbacks between shrubs and trees. We planted seeds and seedlings of Pinus sylvestris in microsites with contrasting water-tables and woody cover and manipulated both shrub canopy and root competition. We monitored seedling emergence, growth and survival for up to four growing seasons and assessed how seedling responses related to abiotic and biotic conditions. We found that tree recruitment is more successful in drier topographical microsites with deeper water-tables. On these hummocks, shrubs have both positive and negative effects on tree seedling establishment. Shrub cover improved tree seedling condition, growth and survival during the warmest growing season. In turn, higher tree basal area correlates positively with soil nutrient availability, shrub biomass and abundance of tree juveniles. Synthesis. Our results suggest that shrubs facilitate tree colonization of peatbogs which further increases shrub growth. These facilitative effects seem to be stronger under warmer conditions suggesting that a higher frequency of warmer and dry summers may lead to stronger positive interactions between shrubs and trees that could eventually facilitate a shift from moss to tree-dominated systems.","2015-01","2025-03-19 13:54:21","2025-09-26 14:14:34","2025-03-19 13:54:21","58-66","","1","103","","Journal of Ecology","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates the positive feedback between shrub cover and tree seedling survival, and the consequent pathways to tree encroachment of peatlands. </p> </div>","","","peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; bog; water table; drawdown; microtopography; woody plants; physiography; hydrological alteration","","Bardgett, Richard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quantifying the rate of C loss from peat soils under forestry is challenging, as soil CO2 efflux includes both CO2 produced from heterotrophic peat decomposition and CO2 produced by tree roots and associated fungal networks (autotrophic respiration). We experimentally terminated autotrophic below-ground respiration in replicated forest plots by cutting through all living tree roots (trenching) and measured soil surface CO2 flux, litter input, litter decay rate, and soil temperature and moisture over 2 years. Decomposition of cut roots was measured and CO2 fluxes were corrected for this, which resulted in a large change in the fraction heterotrophic : autotrophic flux, suggesting that even 2 years after trenching decaying root biomass makes significant contributions to the CO2 flux. Annual peat decomposition (heterotrophic CO2 flux) was 115 ± 16 g C m−2 yr−1, representing ca. 40 % of total soil respiration. Decomposition of needle litter is accelerated in the presence of an active rhizosphere, indicating a priming effect by labile C inputs from roots. This suggests that our estimates of peat mineralization in our trenched plots are conservative and underestimate overall rates of peat C loss. Considering also input of litter from trees, our results indicate that the soils in these 30-year-old drained and afforested peatlands are a net sink for C, since substantially more C enters the soil organic matter than is decomposed heterotrophically. This study does not account for fluvial C fluxes, which represent a small flux compared to the CO2 soil efflux; further, root litter and exudate deposition could be a significant C source that is only partially sampled by our approach, adding to these plantations being a potential carbon sink. However, the C balance for these soils should be taken over the lifespan of the trees, in order to determine if the soils under these drained and afforested peatlands are a sustained sink of C or become a net source over longer periods of forestry.","2022-01-19","2025-03-19 13:54:19","2025-03-19 19:14:39","2025-03-19 13:54:19","313-327","","2","19","","Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the source of CO2 in forested peatlands and demonstrated that 40% of the CO” originates from heterotrophic processes (decompostion). </p> </div>","","","peatland; decomposition; greenhouse gases; peat; drawdown; carbon cycle; woody plants; substrate; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Abundant macroremains of the species were found only in the upper portion of peat deposits. Birch encroachment most often occurred after a fire had spread through the peatland.

In 2015–17, we resurveyed the vascular flora of 76 plots located in 16 bogs of southern Que´ bec (Canada) first sampled in 1982. We evaluated changes in species richness, frequency of occurrence and abundance, while considering species shade-tolerance and preferential habitat. We calculated beta diversity as betweensite similarities in composition, and evaluated differences between the two surveys using tests for homogeneity in multivariate dispersion. We found a significant increase in species richness and beta diversity over the last 35 years associated with major species turnovers, indicating a biotic differentiation of the Sphagnum-bog plant communities. These changes were mostly associated with an increase in the abundance and frequency of shade-tolerant and facultative species, suggesting a global phenomenon of woody encroachment. Because the observed changes occurred in a few decades on sites free of in situ human disturbances, we suggest that they were likely induced by the synergic effect of the agricultural drainage occurring in the surrounding mineral soils, climate warming, and nitrogen atmospheric depositions. We also believe that further changes are to be expected, as the triggering factors persist. Finally, our results highlight the need for increased bog conservation or restauration efforts. Indeed, a rise in beta diversity due to the introduction of nearby terrestrial species could induce biotic homogenization of the bog flora with that of surrounding habitats and ultimately impoverish the regional species pool.","2020-02-13","2025-03-19 13:54:11","2025-03-22 17:01:55","2025-03-19 13:54:11","e0229146","","2","15","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This study resampled ombrotrophic peatlands after 35 years and found an increase in woody plants, likely as a result of agricultural drainage and nutrient enrichment from air pollution. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; bog; drawdown; agriculture; woody plants; hydrological alteration","","Zang, RunGuo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the albedo-induced RF was positive in winter and negative in summer, the summer effect dominated because of greater solar radiation received. The climate cooling effect of GHGs change was due to an increase in the carbon dioxide sink capacity and a reduction in methane emissions under lower water table levels following agricultural drainage and abandonment. Calculation of sustained-flux global warming/cooling potentials also supported this finding. Our results show that the overall increase in albedo resulting from agricultural drainage and abandonment contributes significantly to the negative RF, strengthening the cooling effect due to the changing GHG fluxes.

Over a 6- month period (May - October, 1991), CH4fluxes ranged from −5 to 7 mg CH4 m−2 d−1 and were not correlated with either soil temperature or water table position. Integrated seasonal emissions were −0.40 to 0.04 g CH4 m−2 over 147 days; the sites with a forest or grass cover were a small sink of CH4 whereas the sites with horticultural crops showed no significant flux. Laboratory incubations showed that the highest CH4 consumption rates (3 to 9 μg CH4 g−1 d−1) occurred in the least disturbed soils. The results, when compared with CH4 fluxes from nearby swamps which have been unaffected by drainage, suggest that drainage of temperate peatlands has reduced emissions of CH4 to the atmosphere by 0.6 - 1 × 1012g CH4 yr−1. CO2 fluxes ranged from 0 to 16 g CO2 m−2 d−1 and were correlated with the seasonal pattern of temperature in the upper part of the soil profile.

Using bulk density and loss-on-ignition data, we found that the seasonal CO2 fluxes translate into surface lowering of the peat of about 2 mm yr−1, whereas the commonly observed lowering in these cultivated peatlands is 20 mm yr−1. These data suggest that processes other than direct oxidation, such as shrinkage and aeolian erosion, are the major contributor to the surface lowering of the peat.","1993-06","2025-03-19 13:52:52","2025-03-19 19:08:15","2025-03-19 13:52:52","247-257","","2","7","","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper provides estimates of carbon dioxide and methane emissions in drained peatlands used for agriculture.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; greenhouse gases; peat; water table; drawdown; agriculture; substrate; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This hampers the development of smart mitigation strategies, considering that rewetting to halt peat decomposition and reducing N fertilization are promising N2O emission-­reduction strategies. Here, we used machine learning techniques and global N2O observational data to generalize the distribution of N2O emissions from agriculturally managed peatlands, to distinguish the sources of N2O emissions, and to compare mitigation options. N2O emissions from agriculturally managed croplands were 401.0 (344.5–470.9) kt N year−1, with 121.6 (88.6–163.3) kt N year−1 contributed by fertilizer N. On grasslands, 64.0 (54.6–74.7) kt N2O-­N year−1 were emitted, with 4.6 (3.7–5.7) kt N2O-­N year−1 stemming from fertilizer N. The fertilizer-­induced N2O emission factor ranged from 1.5% to 3.2%. Reducing the current fertilizer input by 20% could achieve a 10% N2O emission reduction for croplands but only 3% for grasslands. Rewetting 1.9 Mha cropland and 0.26 Mha grassland would achieve the same N2O emission reductions. Our results suggest that N2O mitigation strategies for managed peatlands should be considered separately across land-­use types and climatic zones. For croplands, particularly in the tropics, relevant N2O mitigation potentials are achievable through both fertilizer N reduction and peatland rewetting. For grasslands, management schemes to halt peat degradation (e.g. rewetting) should be considered preferentially for mitigating N2O and contributing to meeting climate goals.","2024-01","2025-03-19 13:52:45","2025-03-20 21:25:14","2025-03-19 13:52:45","e17144","","1","30","","Global Change Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the sources of N2O from agricultural peatlands in Europe and Southeast Asia.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; greenhouse gases; nutrients; rewetting; carbon cycle; nutrient enrichment; hydrological management; fertility change/contamination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to assess the impacts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer on N2O emissions from a cultivated organic soil located south of Montre´al, QC, Canada, drained in 1930 and used since then for vegetable production. Fluxes of N2O were measured weekly from May 2004 to November 2005 when snow cover was absent in irrigated and non-irrigated plots receiving 0, 100 or 150 kg N ha−1 as NH4NO3. Soil mineral N content, gas concentrations, temperature, water table height and water content were also measured to help explain variations in N2O emissions. Annual emissions during the experiment were large, ranging from 3.6 to 40.2 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1. The N2O emissions were decreased by N fertilizer addition in the non-irrigated site but not in the irrigated site. The absence of a positive inﬂuence of soil mineral N content on N2O emissions was probably in part because up to 571 kg N ha−1 were mineralized during the snow-free season. Emissions of N2O were positively correlated to soil CO2 emissions and to variables associated with the extent of soil aeration such as soil oxygen concentration, precipitation and soil water table height, thereby indicating that soil moisture/aeration and carbon bioavailability were the main controls of N2O emission. The large N2O emissions observed in this study indicate that drained cultivated organic soils in eastern Canada have a potential for N2O-N losses similar to, or greater than, organic soils located in northern Europe.","2010-04","2025-03-19 13:52:41","2025-03-20 19:52:39","2025-03-19 13:52:41","186-196","","2","61","","European J Soil Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that nutrient enrichment in drained agricultural peatlands increases the high N2O emissions.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; peatland; greenhouse gases; nutrients; drawdown; carbon cycle; nutrient enrichment; agriculture; fertility change/contamination; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 1993-94 plots at lanthe Forest were reharvested to assess biomass production, and at Skiffington Swamp, Westland National Park, seedling densities were surveyed in temporary non-harvested plots to provide a comparison with harvested lowland sites. Sphagnum cover and height growth was rapid in heavily harvested plots and was improved by reseeding. In open sites the height growth of Sphagnum growing among rushes was significantly greater than that of Sphagnum growing alone or with Empodisma. Sphagnum yield in reharvested plots was significantly less than initial biomass. Moss regrowth, as a percentage of initial biomass, was less than 50% at both Pell and Ianthe sites, but was improved by reseeding at both sites. Optimal harvesting depth appears to be to or slightly above the normal position of the water table. Numbers and species of native woody seedlings varied between sites, but there was no significant difference between harvested and related unharvested sites. Seedling numbers were generally negatively correlated with Sphagnum cover, especially in beech dominated communities, i.e., as sphagnum cover increased seedling numbers decreased. Some harvesting guidelines are suggested.","1996","2025-03-19 13:51:49","2025-03-20 21:41:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","New Zealand Department of Conservation","Wellington","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This report presents the results of a monitoring of <em>Sphagnum</em> following its surface harvest in peatlands in New Zealand.</p> </div>","","","peatland; vegetation; primary productivity; bryophytes; sphagnum; vegetation disturbance; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, horticultural peat is only very slowly renewable, and good quality horticultural peat is not common even in peatland-rich countries. Therefore, good-quality and simultaneously renewable alternative growing media are needed. A new growing medium based on Sphagnum moss biomass is introduced in this study. According to our results, harvesting of Sphagnum biomass to a depth of no more than 30 cm will have a relatively short-term effect on Sphagnum carpet coverage and carbon sequestration, allowing a harvesting cycle of ~30 years to be achieved. Therefore, the average harvesting depth will be 30 cm. Only half of the mire surface on each harvesting area will be utilised, the other half being kept intact for transportation routes. This will also secure a reserve of Sphagnum mosses for reseeding and recovery. The end product - Sphagnum biomass based growing medium - will be truly renewable, and environmental effects will be negligible compared with conventional extraction of white horticultural peat. Therefore, Sphagnum biomass harvesting is more comparable with sustainable forestry management than with the production of white peat, which causes drastic and long-term alterations of the mire ecosystem.","2017","2025-03-19 13:50:44","2025-03-20 20:32:06","2025-03-19 13:50:44","1–11","","20","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (CSL JSON)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents a new method of only harvesting the top 30 cm of peat in peatlands and describes the effects on carbon sequestration.</p> </div>","","","peatland; vegetation; substrate disturbance; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; sphagnum; vegetation disturbance; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to vegetation succession, GHG emissions were moisture dependent. In wet sites CH4 emissions increased along with time since harvesting and Eriophorum vaginatum (L.) cover, while dry sites exhibited overall lower CH4 fluxes. Younger (1–2 years post-harvest), dry sites were significant CO2 sources due to low photo­ synthetic activity. Older dry site with sparse ericoid shrub vegetation acted as CO2 sink.

Our studies showed that 90% of new shoots recorded in 6-mo of measurements appeared within the first 12 cm depth.

Restoration of drained and extracted peatlands can potentially return them to carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks, thus acting as significant climate change mitigation. However, whether the restored sites will remain sinks or switch to sources with a changing climate is unknown. Therefore, we adapted the CoupModel to simulate ecosystem CO2 fluxes and the associated influencing factors of a restored bog. The study site was a peatland in eastern Canada that was extracted for 8 years and left for 20 years before restoration. The model outputs were first evaluated against 3 years (representing 14–16 years post-restoration) of eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), surface energy fluxes, soil temperature profiles, and water table depth data. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the response of the simulated CO2 fluxes to the thickness of the newly grown mosses. The validated model was then used to assess the sensitivity to changes in climate forcing. The CoupModel reproduced the measured surface energy fluxes and showed high agreement with the observed soil temperature, water table depth, and NEE data. The simulated NEE varied slightly when changing the thickness of newly grown mosses and acrotelm from 0.2 to 0.4 m but showed significantly less uptake for a 1 m thickness. The simulated NEE was -95±19gCm-2yr-1 over the 3 evaluation years and -101±64gCm-2yr-1, ranging from −219 to +54gCm-2yr-1, with extended 28-year climate data. After 14 years of restoration, the peatland has a mean CO2 uptake rate similar to pristine sites but with a much larger interannual variability, and in dry years, the restored peatland can switch back to a temporary CO2 source. The model predicts a moderate reduction in CO2 uptake but still a reasonable sink under future climate change conditions if the peatland is ecologically and hydrologically restored. The ability of the CoupModel to simulate the CO2 dynamics and its thermo-hydro-drivers for restored peatlands has important implications for emission accounting and climate-smart management of drained peatlands.","2025-03-12","2025-03-19 14:34:56","2025-03-19 16:04:09","2025-03-19 14:34:56","1355-1368","","5","22","","Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper uses carbon tower fluxes to model the longer-term carbon dynamics in a restored peat-extracted peatland in south-eastern Québec.

The net mineralization of N and P were minimal at the Burned areas relative to Unburned areas. Fire aﬀected plant nutrient limitation patterns, switching from dominantly N-limited to NP co-limited and P-limitation in moss and vascular species respectively. The top 20 cm of the Burned area C concentrations was higher relative to the Unburned area, with increased CN and CP ratios also being found in the Burned area.

While small-scale variation in burn severity can reduce postﬁre moss water availability, high water table (WT) positions following wildﬁre are also critical to enable the re-establishment of keystone peatland mosses (i.e. Sphagnum). Thus, post-ﬁre moss water availability is also likely a function of landscape-scale controls on peatland WT dynamics, speciﬁcally, connectivity to groundwater ﬂow systems (i.e. hydrogeological setting). For this reason, we assessed the interacting controls of hydrogeological setting and burn severity on post-ﬁre moss water availability in three burned, Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in Alberta’s Boreal Plains. At all sites, variation in burn severity resulted in a dichotomy between post-ﬁre surface covers that: (1) exhibited low water availability, regardless of WT position, and had minimal (<5%) moss re-establishment (i.e. lightly burned feather mosses and severely burned Sphagnum fuscum) or (2) exhibited high water availability, depending on WT position, and had substantial (>50%) moss re-establishment (i.e. lightly burned S. fuscum and where depth of burn was >0.05 m). Notably, hydrogeological setting inﬂuenced the spatial coverage of these post-ﬁre surface covers by inﬂuencing pre-ﬁre WTs and stand characteristics (e.g., shading). Because feather moss cover is controlled by tree shading, lightly burned feather mosses were ubiquitous (>25%) in drier peatlands (deeper pre-ﬁre WTs) that were densely treed and had little connection to large groundwater ﬂow systems. Moreover, hydrogeological setting also controlled post-ﬁre WT positions, thereby affecting moss re-establishment in post-ﬁre surface covers that were dependent on WT position (e.g., lightly burned S. fuscum). Accordingly, higher recolonization rates were observed in a peatland located in a groundwater ﬂow through system that had a shallow post-ﬁre WT. Therefore, we argue that hydrogeological setting inﬂuences post-ﬁre recovery in two ways: (1) by inﬂuencing vegetation structure prior to wildﬁre, thereby controlling the coverage of post-ﬁre surface covers and (2) by inﬂuencing post-ﬁre WT positions. These results suggest that post-ﬁre moss recovery in peatlands isolated from groundwater ﬂow systems may be particularly susceptible to droughts and future climate change.","2015-11","2025-03-19 14:36:00","2025-03-19 20:44:17","2025-03-19 14:36:00","405-418","","","530","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the reasons for a dichotomy in post-fire recovery in sites with low water availability and low moss re-establishment versus sites with high water availability and high moss re-establishment.</p> </div>","","","Canada; fire; hydrology; peatland; vegetation; groundwater; water table; soil moisture; bryophytes; sphagnum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We experimentally altered soil moisture profiles of peat monoliths collected from several vegetation types common in boreal bogs and used laboratory burn tests to examine the effects of depth-dependent variation in bulk density and moisture on depth of fuel consumption. Depth of burning ranged from 1 to 17 cm, comparable with observations following natural wildfires. Individually, fuel bulk density and moisture were unreliable predictors of depth of burning. However, they demonstrated a cumulative influence on the thermodynamics of downward combustion propagation. By modifying Van Wagner’s surface fuel consumption model to account for stratigraphic changes in fuel conditions, we were able to accurately predict the maximum depth of fuel consumption for most of the laboratory burn tests. This modified model for predicting the depth of surface fuel consumption in boreal ecosystems may provide a useful framework for informing wildland fire management activities and guiding future development of operational fire behaviour and carbon emission models.","2011","2025-03-19 14:35:55","2025-03-19 18:03:16","2025-03-19 14:35:55","418","","3","20","","Int.

Although topographic complexity is a major driver of fire refugia in mountainous terrain, refugia in boreal plains are more likely driven by a combination of other bottom‐up controls on fuel configuration as well as top‐down climate controls. In this study, we investigated the role of hydrological, ecological, and topographic heterogeneity, as well as climate moisture patterns, on the presence of fire refugia in forested upland and peatland ecosystems within Alberta's subhumid boreal forests over a 33‐year (1985–2018) period. Generalized linear models were used to model the probability of refugia in forested stands as a function of bottom‐up (vegetation, topography, site moisture, and ecosystem) and top‐down (normal and annual climate moisture deficit) controls. We then developed predictive maps of refugia probability for a range of normal and interannual climate moisture deficit values. We found that forested fens had a probability of refugia that was 64% higher than upland forests, while forested bogs did not differ from forested uplands in refugia likelihood. Climate and physical setting presented the strongest controls on fire refugia in uplands and peatlands, respectively. Increasing amounts of adjacent bogs, but not fens, produced a sixfold increase in refugia probability in uplands, while increasing amounts of adjacent bogs and fens produced roughly two times the refugia probability in forested peatlands. In these upland forest stands, fire refugia probability was negatively related to the interaction between regional climate moisture deficits and interannual deviations from these norms, thus increasing the probability of fire refugia during more severe drought conditions in areas with less arid climates, while decreasing refugia probabilities in drier climates. However, in peatlands themselves, neither regional climate moisture conditions nor the interannual deviations affected refugia. Fire size had a negative effect on fire refugia in all upland‐based models and a positive effect in all peatland‐based models. Our results suggest that large areas of intact peatlands may be capable of promoting fire refugia and thereby slowing climate‐driven, fire‐mediated vegetation transitions in surrounding forest ecosystems.","2023","2025-03-19 14:40:04","2025-11-18 19:09:48","2025-03-19 14:40:04","e4510","","5","14","","Ecosphere","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that bottom-up controls from soil moisture and vegetation of peatlands create refugia for biota in boreal forests.

The goal of this project was to determine if winter burning was successful in reducing the dominance (mean percentage cover and maximum height) of Cornus sericea in sedge meadows in southern Wisconsin, where shrubs proliferated after cattle were excluded. Experimental burn and control plots were set up within sedge meadows, including an ungrazed “reference” site that had been little, if ever, grazed and a “historically grazed” site, a recovery site that had not been grazed by cattle since 1973. None of the dominant species including C. sericea was significantly affected by burning for either mean percentage cover or maximum height (analysis of variance: no burning × species interaction). Both mean percentage cover and maximum height were only weakly related to burning (28.1 and 14.3% of the variability contributed to the cumulative percentage of the coefficient of determination, respectively) at both sites based on non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis. Although species richness increased in burned plots in 1999 and 2000, no differences were apparent between pre-burned and unburned plots in 1997 and unburned plots in 1999 and 2000 (analysis of variance: year × burning interaction). After burning in the ungrazed site, herbaceous species appeared that had not been detected for decades, including Chelone glabra and Lathyrus palustris. Exotic species were present in both the ungrazed reference and recovery site. Although winter burning treatments did not reduce the dominance of woody shrub species in the site recovering from cattle grazing, burning was useful in stimulating the maintenance of species richness in the ungrazed sedge meadow.","2002-12","2025-03-19 14:40:26","2025-03-20 19:23:26","2025-03-19 14:40:26","723-730","","4","10","","Restoration Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper tests the practice of winter prescribed burns to remove shrubs on the vegetation in fens and other wetlands in Wisconsin.</p> </div>","","","fire; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; other wetland; fen; swamp; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; woody plants; marsh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peatlands in the Australian Alps are important ecologically and recognised in national environmental legislation. Increasing ﬁre frequency over the past 40 years has put the community at greater risk of degradation. Aims. Using published studies of ﬁre effects in peatlands and new data, we investigate general responses of peatlands to ﬁre so that risk can be evaluated and appropriate management adopted. Methods. We present four case studies that employ repeated measures of ﬂoristic composition or chronosequences to assess ﬁre-related changes. Key results. Cover of frequently-occurring species declined after ﬁre but most had returned to pre-ﬁre cover after 10 years. Recovery of the obligate seeder shrub Dracophyllum continentis (B.L.Burtt) S.Venter and the dominant moss Sphagnum cristatum Hampe was much slower, but variable for the latter, apparently depending on ﬁre intensity and post-ﬁre moisture availability; both species favoured less frequently burnt peatlands with high soil moisture. Some herbs (including non-native species) beneﬁtted from ﬁre, brieﬂy becoming abundant soon afterwards. Overall species richness and diversity were unaffected by ﬁre. Conclusions. Peatlands in the Australian Alps tend to be resilient to single ﬁres with effects on species composition being short-lived. However, species cover (especially Sphagnum cristatum) requires perhaps 20 years between ﬁres for full recovery. Fire can cause localised community extinction and this is likely to be exacerbated by other pressures such as trampling and drought. Implications. Fire will be difﬁcult to manage in peatlands but resilience might be built by removing other pressures such as trampling by feral animals.","2023-04-17","2025-03-19 14:40:23","2025-03-20 19:01:13","2025-03-19 14:40:23","111-126","","3","71","","Aust.

Margin recovery trajectories have potentially important implications for wildfire behaviour as both the rate of vegetation recovery and community composition control fuel load and flammability. We compared peatland margin and middle vegetation trajectories using a chronosequence of time-since-fire in boreal Alberta, Canada. Margins had unique post-fire indicator species, with a higher broadleaf cover and limited Sphagnum moss colonization. Middles and margins became less distinct with greater time-since-fire, where both were dominated by feathermoss as canopy closure increased. High burn severity in margins can expose the seedbank in the underlying mineral soil to favourable conditions, causing rapid accumulation of broadleaf aboveground biomass and limiting Sphagnum establishment. The rapid accumulation of aboveground biomass increases potential fuel load, while exclusion of Sphagnum increases future smouldering potential given the dense peat in the margin ecotone. However, the dominance of deciduous vegetation for several decades post fire would serve to limit wildfire compared to a conifer-dominated system, particularly post leaf-out. Thus, peatland margins could represent a positive feedback to peat carbon loss for early season fires and a negative feedback for post leaf-out fires due to the interplay between fuel load, fire seasonality, and species flammability. Characterization of margins as distinct ecotones with a separate vegetation structure and species composition from peatland middles provides critical insight about wildfire vulnerability and carbon storage in the Boreal Plains.","2024-04","2025-03-19 14:40:21","2025-03-20 18:57:52","2025-03-19 14:40:21","44","","4","44","","Wetlands","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper compares the periphery versus the middle of peatlands in Alberta &nbsp;to assess post-fire recovery and fire risk.</p> </div>","","","Canada; fire; peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; substrate disturbance; carbon cycle; bryophytes; sphagnum; smouldering; vegetation disturbance; woody plants; carbon storage; ecotone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At all sites, the oldest larch trees became established around 1640–1680, and several individuals survived each fire identified across the uplands. However, partial disturbance during the most recent 1941 fire, which was associated with severe fire weather, decreased tree density and released the growth of several trees. Although signs of previous fire may have been lost through wood decay, no fire impacted larch growth as severely as the 1941 fire, further emphasizing the modest influence of fire in string fens as compared with uplands.

We exposed the Sphagnum spores of four selected species (S. angustifolium, S. fuscum, S. magellanicum and S. squarrosum) collected from peatlands in the Changbai Mountains to heat (40, 60 and 100 ◦C), on its own and combined with smoke-water treatments. Our results showed that a heat of 100 ◦C inhibited the spore germination or even killed spores of all species, while spore germination of three (Sphagnum angustifolium, S. fuscum and S. squarrosum) of the four species was promoted by 40 and 60 ◦C heat compared to the control (20 ◦C). Hollow species (S. angustifolium and S. squarrosum) showed a stronger positive responsive to heat than hummock species (S. fuscum and S. magellanicum). Sphagnum fuscum spores responded positively to the combined heat and smoke treatment while the other species did not. For the ﬁrst time, we demonstrate the positive effects of heat on its own and in combination with smoke on spore germination in wetland mosses, which may be important for the establishment and persistence of peatmoss populations after ﬁre.","2022-02-11","2025-03-19 14:41:01","2025-03-20 21:27:45","2025-03-19 14:41:01","485","","4","11","","Plants","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates how fire stimulates the germination of Sphagnum spores in peatlands.</p> </div>","","","peatland; vegetation; bryophytes; sphagnum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ashed peat (AH) was normally first colonised by Ceratodon purpureus, followed by Polytrichum piliferum with dominance later tending to pass to P. commune. Charred surfaces and progressively granulating peat (GP) remained largely bare except for patches of Dicranella heteromalla, Pohlia nutans and Polytrichum spp.  2 On charred surfaces recreated in this study and GP bryophyte cover was < 10% after one year, compared with 22% on ash. Shelter and lime treatments resulted in nearly 100% cover on some charred peat and ash, but superficially charred peat and GP still had < 50% cover.  3 Glasshouse trials confirmed that charred surfaces and GP had some residual chemical deficiency or toxicity even when physical conditions were improved.  4 In hanging-drop cultures, Pohlia nutans germinated well on extracts of all surface-types and Funaria hygrometrica germinated well on extracts from AH and GP; Polytrichum commune gave about 10% germination on AH, and D. heteromalla about 10% germination on AH and GP. Germination of C. purpureus on all the burnt surfaces, and of F. hygrometrica on the charred surfaces appeared to be nutrient or pH-limited. Germination of F. hygrometrica, D. heteromalla and the Polytrichum species was apparently inhibited to varying degrees by water-soluble extracts from the charred surfaces.  5 Protonema of Pohlia nutans grew well on extracts from all surfaces. D. heteromalla grew well on AH and to some extent on GP; F. hygrometrica showed some growth on extracts from AH and GP. Growth of C. purpureus and D. heteromalla appeared to be nutrient- or pH-limited on some or all of the burnt surfaces. Extracts from the burnt surfaces reduced growth of F. hygrometrica and almost or completely suppressed growth of Campylopus pyriformis and the Polytrichum species.  6 The pH appeared to be an important factor affecting germination and growth for most species; there was a significant positive correlation between germination and pH of the culture solution (range 3.5-6.4) for all species but Ceratodon purpureus and Pohlia nutans.  7 In glasshouse trials, toxicity from lichen/alga crusts on intact peat surfaces reduced germination of D. heteromalla by c. 50%; the similar effect on germination of Polytrichum piliferum was not statistically significant.  8 Wind-tunnel experiments showed that the surface of charred peats and GP dried quicker than AH under high-radiation conditions. Except for Campylopus pyriformis, which survived to -390 MPa, the protonema of all the mosses was killed by 24 h exposure at -23 MPa; protonema of Polytrichum commune was the most sensitive to slight desiccation.  9 Ash is chemically and physically favourable for moss establishment. Freshly charred surfaces are chemically unfavourable. Establishment on these surfaces can only occur if there is an adequate interval between amelioration of chemical conditions and the onset of physical instability and granulation of the peat surface.","1994-09","2025-03-19 14:40:55","2025-03-20 20:40:13","2025-03-19 14:40:55","457","","3","82","","The Journal of Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates how fire stimulates the colonization and establishment of bryophytes on peatlands. </p> </div>","","","fire; peatland; vegetation; bryophytes; vegetation disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, bryophytes were mostly disturbance-adapted species, and non-vascular biomass had recovered less than vascular plant biomass. Soil nitrogen availability did not differ between burned and unburned sites. Graminoids showed allocation changes consistent with nitrogen stress.

We investigated the effects offire on the vegetation of a New Zealand peat bog through analysis of microclimate patterns, vegetation change, and peat stratigraphy. We focused on the role offire in sustaining threatened plant species such as the critically endangered orchid Corybas carsei. Experimental fire significantly increased the surface radiation and daytime soil temperature, and these elevated levels of radiation and temperature persisted 53 months after burning. Immediately after fire no living plant material remained in the burn plots, but within 2 months many of the rhizomatous species were resprouting and 50 months later had returned to prefire abundance. Obligate-seeding species did not recover their former abundance, but several species not observed in the plots prior to the burns established after fire. Species richness, diversity, and evenness increased following fire but declined in the control plots. Species dominance decreased after fire but increased in the control plots. C. carsei which was killed during the fire, reappeared in the burn plots I year later at a higher density than prior to burning and was still present 4 years after fire. C. carsei flowering was also enhanced following the fire. Wef ound evidence of historical fires, which was supported by radiocarbon dates from a much older adjacent wetland.

Projections indicate that future drought and wildfire events will be more frequent and severe, enhancing moisture deficits and threatening the functional role of peatlands as net carbon sinks. Peatland margins existing at the peatland-upland interface have been identified as deep smouldering hotspots on the landscape, where margin carbon loss accounts for 50 to 90% of total peatland carbon loss, dependent on hydrogeological setting. Previous chronosequence analysis of peatland bog recovery from wildfire disturbance has chronicled a return to carbon sink status within 20 years, but has not included margins nor peatlands located in coarse or heterogeneous-textured hydrogeological settings with varying degrees of groundwater connectivity. This analysis identifies and describes margin vegetation communities and recovery trajectories with time since fire and across hydrogeological settings. No significant differences were identified in margin area over time or margin peat depths across hydrogeological settings. Margin canopy composition consists of mixed coniferous and broadleaf deciduous species, with enhanced litterfall characterizing the dominant early to mid successional ground layer composition. Both peatland bog middle and margin vegetation communities were found to be dominated by feathermoss growth ~60 years following wildfire, which represents an accelerated trajectory from previous chronosequence analyses. Increased peatland and margin fuel loads with time since fire are also demonstrated using aboveground biomass calculations. Restoration practitioners can use this study to identify recovery milestones and altered trajectories, with their associated feedbacks, that perpetuate a broadleaf canopy and limited Sphagnum moss paludification. Fire managers should include confined peatlands in coarse-textured hydrogeological settings with deep smouldering margins in their management considerations and consider intervention (forest treatments) to open the canopy and prevent legacy carbon losses by severe wildfires.","2017","2025-03-19 14:41:20","2025-03-19 19:30:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","McMaster University","Hamilton","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis examines uses a chronosequence approach to examine the changes in vegetation in the periphery of peatland, where smouldering risk is greatest. </p> </div>","","","Canada; fire; peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; substrate disturbance; vegetation disturbance; woody plants; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Species with rhizomes that survived the fires were able to resprout and grow rapidly in the initial post-fire period. Species that were eliminated had to re-establish from seed and so recovered more slowly. The vegetation at Moanatuatua took almost 12 years to recover to pre-fire condition, twice as long as at Whangamarino. Adventive and early colonising native species were prominent only in the first 1-2 post-fire years, probably because of temporarily increased availability of nutrients and/or open habitat. Ordination techniques arranged the plots and species in a sequence from shrub-sedgeland (Whangamarino), through Empodisma minus restiad rushland (Whangamarino), to Sporadanthus traversii/ Empodisma restiad rushland (Moanatuatua) following a gradient of decreasing fertility with time. Fires reset the bog development process but generally do not alter the recovery pathways.

In addition, this review aims to identify the gaps in the present knowledge on the greenhouse gas (GHG) balances associated with the land-use of these northern ecosystems. Northern peatlands have accumulated, as peat, a vast amount of carbon from the atmosphere since the last glaciation. However, the past land-use and present climate have evidently changed their GHG balance. Unmanaged boreal peatlands may act as net sources or sinks for CO2 and CH4 depending on the weather conditions. Drainage for agriculture has turned peatlands to significant sources of GHGs (mainly N2O and CO2). Annual mean GHG balances including net CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions are 2260, 2280 and 3140 g CO2 eq. m−2 (calculated using 100 year time horizon) for areas drained for grass swards, cereals or those left fallow, respectively. Even after cessetion of the cultivation practices, N2O and CO2 emissions remain high. The mean net GHG emissions in abandoned and afforested agricultural peatlands have been 1580 and 500 g CO2 eq. m−2, respectively. Peat extraction sites are net sources of GHGs with an average emission rate of 770 g CO2 eq. m−2. Cultivation of a perennial grass (e.g., reed canary grass) on an abandoned peat extraction site has been shown to convert such a site into a net sink of GHGs (−330 g CO2 eq. m−2). In contrast, despite restoration, such sites are known to emit GHGs (mean source of 480 g CO2 eq. m−2, mostly from high CH4 emissions). Peatland forests, originally drained for forestry, may act as net sinks (mean −780 g CO2 eq. m−2). However, the studies where all three GHGs have been measured at an ecosystem level in the forested peatlands are lacking. The data for restored peatland forests (clear cut and rewetted) indicate that such sites are on average a net sink (190 g CO2 eq. m−2). The mean emissions from drained peatlands presented here do not include emissions from ditches which form a part of the drainage network and can contribute significantly to the total GHG budget. Peat soils submerged under water reservoirs have acted as sources of CO2, CH4 and N2O (mean annual emission 240 g CO2 eq. m−2). However, we cannot yet predict accurately the overall greenhouse gas fluxes of organic soils based on the site characteristics and land-use practices alone because the data on many land-use options and our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling associated with the gas fluxes are limited.","2010-09-15","2025-03-19 14:44:15","2025-03-19 21:03:02","2025-03-19 14:44:15","2711-2738","","9","7","","Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the knowledge on greenhouse gas emissions from boreal peatlands in Scandinavia and the impacts of drainage and restoration practices on these emissions. </p> </div>","","","peatland; greenhouse gases; drawdown; carbon cycle; forest harvest; agriculture; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many peatlands are under pressure from drainage-based agriculture, plantation development and fire, with the equivalent of around 3 per cent of all anthropogenic greenhouse gases emitted from drained peatland. Efforts to curb such emissions are intensifying through the conservation of undrained peatlands and re-wetting of drained systems6. Here we report eddy covariance data for carbon dioxide from 16 locations and static chamber measurements for methane from 41 locations in the UK and Ireland. We combine these with published data from sites across all major peatland biomes. We find that the mean annual effective water table depth (WTDe; that is, the average depth of the aerated peat layer) overrides all other ecosystem- and management-related controls on greenhouse gas fluxes. We estimate that every 10 centimetres of reduction in WTDe could reduce the net warming impact of CO2 and CH4 emissions (100-year global warming potentials) by the equivalent of at least 3 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year, until WTDe is less than 30 centimetres. Raising water levels further would continue to have a net cooling effect until WTDe is within 10 centimetres of the surface. Our results suggest that greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands drained for agriculture could be greatly reduced without necessarily halting their productive use. Halving WTDe in all drained agricultural peatlands, for example, could reduce emissions by the equivalent of over 1 per cent of global anthropogenic emissions.","2021-05-27","2025-03-19 14:44:43","2025-03-19 18:56:45","2025-03-19 14:44:43","548-552","","7860","593","","Nature","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that high water table effectively reduces greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands. </p> </div>","","","climate change; hydrology; peatland; greenhouse gases; water table; carbon sequestration; drawdown; rewetting; carbon cycle; agriculture; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined early post-fire vegetation regeneration following the 2011 Utikuma complex fire (central Alberta, Canada). This study examined 779 peatlands and adjacent ecotones, covering an area of ~182 km2. Based on the known regional fire history, peatlands that burned in 2011 were stratified into either long return interval (LRI) fire regimes of >80 years (i.e., no recorded prior fire history) or short fire return interval (SRI) of 55 years (i.e., within the boundary of a documented severe fire in 1956). Data from six multitemporal airborne lidar surveys were used to quantify trajectories of vegetation change for 8 years prior to and 8 years following the 2011 fire. To date, no studies have quantified the impacts of post-fire regeneration following short versus long return interval fires across this broad range of peatlands with variable environmental and post-fire successional trajectories. We found that SRI peatlands demonstrated more rapid vascular and shrub growth rates, especially in peatland centers, than LRI peatlands. Bogs and fens burned in 1956, and with little vascular vegetation (classified as “open peatlands”) prior to the 2011 fire, experienced the greatest changes. These peatlands tended to transition to vascular/shrub forms following the SRI fire, while open LRI peatlands were not significantly different from pre-fire conditions. The results of this study suggest the emergence of a positive feedback, where areas experiencing SRI fires in southern boreal peatlands are expected to transition to forested vegetation forms. Along fen edges and within bog centers, SRI fires are expected to reduce local peatland groundwater moisture-holding capacity and promote favorable conditions for increased fire frequency and severity in the future.","2024-02","2025-03-19 14:46:24","2025-03-21 13:50:40","2025-03-19 14:46:24","e17185","","2","30","","Global Change Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This study uses LIDaR to examine the change in vegetation following fires in peatlands in the boreal forest and demonstrates that shortened fire interval leads to shifts towards forested peatlands. </p> </div>","","","Canada; climate change; fire; peatland; vegetation; bog; remote sensing; fen; LiDAR; vegetation disturbance; airborne lidar; change detection; wetland monitoring; wildland fire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thermal cracking of volatile organic carbons (VOCs) generated from pyrolysis of peat was enhanced in the presence of CO2. Besides the enhanced thermal cracking of VOCs, unknown reaction between CO2and VOCs was also identified. Accordingly, CO2played a role in enhancing syngas production and in reducing tar formation in pyrolysis of peat. This study also reveals that peat-biochar produced in CO2exhibited a larger surface area than that produced in N2.

Different physical protection methods (windbreaks, artificial cover and straw mulch) were tested to facilitate sphagnum establishment on peat substrates that had a partial or complete loss of the acrotelm layer. On sites where the former acrotelm layer of the mire had been completely removed by peat harvesting activities, the straw mulch spread over shredded, reintroduced mire plant material significantly enhanced the establishment of Sphagnum spp. and other bryophytes. On the other hand, the windbreaks and plastic artificial cover had no effect. This effect was independent of the mean water table depth underlying the peat surface to be restored. In favourable conditions (i.e. a site with a mean water table rarely below 65 cm), mire plant material that had been collected and spread mechanically reached close to a 50% cover in three seasons. Likewise, sites with a partial acrotelm remaining (mire plant borrow sites) recovered better when a straw mulch was applied in the first year. In the second year, sphagna reached nearly 60% cover with or without a straw mulch applied. Before concluding that a protecting device is not necessary in sites with partial acrotelm remaining, it would be important to verily the effect of different seasonal climatic conditions on moss regeneration success.","1997","2025-03-20 22:04:09","2025-03-21 12:42:09","","20-28","","","7","","International Peat Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents the early experiments to restore peatalnds that have damaged or removed surface vegetation and peat. </p> </div>","","","Canada; vegetation; substrate disturbance; bryophytes; sphagnum; donor site; vegetation disturbance; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drainage alters peatland soil environments in complex ways, affecting factors such as water table, soil temperature, organic carbon (SOC), pH, and microbial communities. However, how these factors interact to influence GHG emissions remains unclear. In this study, we compared water table, soil temperature, soil properties, microbial community structure, and GHG emissions across three zones of a peatland in Northeast China undergoing drainage: drained, transition, and natural areas. The average water table in the drained area was significantly lower than in the natural area (from 11.45 cm to -13.47 cm), shifting from waterlogged to unsaturated conditions. Deep soil temperatures in the drained area decreased by 1 ~ 3 °C. The pH of the upper soil layer was higher in the drained area (5.05 ~ 5.29 vs. 4.64 ~ 4.71), while SOC was lower (197.31 ~ 374.75 g/kg vs. 437.05 ~ 512.71 g/kg). Aerobic bacteria (mainly Solibacter) were more abundant in the drained area, while methanogens (mainly hydrogenotrophic) declined significantly. Fungal diversity increased from the natural to drained area with increased negative interactions and enhanced network modularity. Drainage reduced CH4 emissions but increased CO2 and N2O emissions, resulting in a significant rise in net GHG emissions (8.86 ~ 10.65 vs. 22.27 ~ 24.26 t CO2-eq·ha⁻¹·season⁻¹), primarily driven by increased CO2. CO2 emissions were positively correlated with soil temperature, aerobic bacteria, facultatively anaerobic bacteria and pH, but negatively correlated with water table, anaerobic bacteria, soil moisture and C/N ratio. CH4 flux was positively correlated with methanogens and water table, but negatively correlated with pH. The effects of drainage were more pronounced near drainage ditches, particularly for CO2 emissions, highlighting the localized impacts of drainage on peatland GHG fluxes.","2025-03-10","2025-03-21 13:16:16","2025-03-21 13:20:15","","8320","","1","15","","Scientific Reports","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that water table drawdown increases greenhouse gas release, especially CO2 and N2O, from peatlands in China.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; hydrology; greenhouse gases; microbial activity; nutrients; water table; drawdown; carbon cycle; ditching; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In two Wisconsin natural areas (Lulu Lake and Summerton), we assessed the effects of time since prescribed spring burning on plant composition and aboveground biomass in eight sedge meadows representing a partial chronosequence of zero to seven years since burning, plus no burning. We recorded plant species cover in line-intercept transects and measured live biomass and litter in sample plots along transects. Responses were prominent during the first two pears after burning. In the Lulu Lake meadows, live biomass and annual forb cover reached their highest values during the first growing season after burning, whereas cover and frequency of perennial forbs were elevated for two seasons. Plant litter was removed by burning but returned to preburn levels in one to two years. In the Summerton meadows, where seven years had elapsed since the last fire, burned and unburned meadows did not differ in Live biomass, litter, or relative cover of plant life-forms. It appears that periodic burns do not cause major shifts in the relative dominance of sedges and grasses, which are long-lived clonal perennials. However, because litter removal promotes recruitment of shorter-lived forbs, prescribed fire can enhance sedge meadow diversity by allowing plant species with different life histories to temporarily share dominance with the more abundant graminoids. Periodic seed inputs by forbs to the wetland seed bank may be a desirable fire management objective for maintaining sedge meadow diversity.","2000-01","2025-03-21 13:26:43","2025-03-21 13:31:43","2000-01-01","36-45","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000085019900005","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper characterizes the vegetation response after fire in sedge meadows (fens) in Wisconsin.</p> </div>","","","fire; peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; fen; vegetation disturbance; graminoids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Location: European and North American fens. Methods: This paper is a review of the literature on the effects of grazing, fire and cutting on fens, to explore the relationship between management and biodiversity in fens. Results: A reduction of cattle grazing, mowing and burning in fens has led to a reduction in biodiversity in fens. The vegetation of abandoned fens shifts to trees and shrubs after 10?15 years, which shade the smaller and rarer species of these wetlands. While careful use of fire is used to manage fens in North America, it is not widely used in European fens, perhaps because the peat of drained fens may catch fire. Cattle grazing cannot be considered a natural disturbance in North America, since cattle did not evolve on that continent. In Europe, cattle do not generally graze in unaltered fens, but they do use slightly drained fen meadows. Conclusions: Three approaches have been used to control the dominance of tall woody and herbaceous species in abandoned fens, including the re-introduction of cattle, mowing, and burning. Overgrazing results in a permanent reduction in biodiversity, therefore cattle re-introduction must be approached cautiously. In Europe, but not in North America, mowing has been an important management tool, and mowing has been successful in maintaining species richness, particularly in fens that have been mowed annually for centuries. Fire has been the most common and successful management tool in North America although it is not effective in removing shrubs that have become large. Because the problems and solutions are similar, the literature of both European and North American fen management can be analyzed to better assess the management of fens on both continents. Many management questions require further study and these are listed in the paper.","2006-11-01","2025-03-21 13:52:35","2025-03-21 14:00:06","2025-03-21","307-316","","2","9","","Applied Vegetation Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the effects of different disturbances (removals of plant biomass) on the diversity of the vegetation in fens and sedge meadow peatlands in North America and Europe.</p> </div>","","","fire; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; fen; mitigation hierarchy; vegetation disturbance; woody plants; graminoids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors describe the formation of peat bogs; different types of peat bogs, including fen peatlands, raised bogs, and blanket bogs; the engineering properties of peat; the ecology and geomorphology of peatlands; the management of peatlands, including for fuel, horticulture, agriculture, grazing, reforestation, science and tourism, and hunting and harvesting; other attributes of peat moorlands, notably recreation and visual amenity, and archeological and paleo-ecological values; and standard pipeline construction and reinstatement in peat, including topsoil stripping and storage; peat bog crossing methods, including trenching, pipe storage and installation, prevention of pollution, and stabilization and reinstatement. The authors conclude that the costs associated with peat construction may be considerable. The involvement of engineers with contracting and construction experience is vital in the early stages of route selection. Removal and reinstatement of the upper turf layer is a key component of successful methodologies. They stress that monitoring and aftercare are a vital part of the overall process and should not be overlooked.","2005","2025-03-21 19:46:28","2025-03-22 18:42:54","","582-601","","","","","","","","","","","","London","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This report presents best management practices for pipelines in peatlands.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; best management practices; linear disturbance; linear feature; impact minimization; mitigation hierarchy; pipelines; hydrological alteration; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents results from Canada’s pilot Oil Sands Monitoring (OSM) Wetland Program. This study is part of a project that seeks to assess and determine which of a selection of wetland indicators is suitable for identifying changes to wetland ecosystem “states” within a regional wetland monitoring program resulting from the effects of oil sands development. Specifically, this study seeks to identify indicators that can detect changes in a wetland ecosystem “state” using data from a 3-year pilot of the OSM Wetland Program and identify potential high-level oil sands-related pathways through which changes in states may occur, where appropriate. The monitoring data acquired during the pilot program are synthesized to identify preliminary trends and programmatic knowledge gaps, and future recommendations for an improved long-term “core” monitoring program are discussed. This study does not seek to attribute changes in wetland states measured via indicators to specific oil sands pressures but focuses on identifying those indicators that are sensitive enough to identify change over time. The results suggest that water quality, benthic invertebrates, and vegetation indicators can identify changes in wetland states over time, whereas wildlife indicators are inconclusive. Further, it is recommended that hydrometeorology data are acquired in parallel to other indicator data for contextualizing climate conditions. The findings from this work provide insights for developing and transitioning the OSM Wetland Program to a long-term effort, in addition to providing information for other regional wetland monitoring programs.","2023","2025-03-21 19:56:30","2025-09-26 20:31:55","","","","10","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper evaluates best indicators to assess the health of peatlands and other wetlands in the Alberta oil sands region.</p> </div>","","","Canada; cumulative effects; peatland; vegetation; other wetland; water quality; monitoring; biomonitoring; arthropods; fauna; vegetation disturbance; climate; fertility change/contamination; hydrological alteration; macroinvertebrates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response, government and industry agencies are pursuing the development of a regional wetland monitoring program, with two main objectives: (1) measure the cumulative effects of natural and anthropogenic factors on wetlands (i.e. detect an impact); and, (2) detect changes in wetlands associated with specific anthropogenic activities (i.e. diagnose what caused an impact). As part of this process, we were tasked with identifying drivers and response variables for wetlands that could be included in a wetland monitoring program. We summarized human footprint data for the three subregions (Cold Lake, Athabasca, and Peace River) of the Alberta OSR to determine the drivers most likely affecting wetlands in the region, and described potential stressors associated with these human activities to provide context for the selection of potential indicator variables and environmental covariates. Major impacts were agriculture, forestry, upstream oil and gas, and mining. We reviewed previous work done on wetland monitoring program design and identification of potential indicators in the OSR and elsewhere to develop a list of candidate indicators for (a) cumulative effects monitoring, and (b) diagnostic monitoring to detect impacts associated with specific human activities (mining, oil and gas, agriculture, forestry, and urbanization).

Here we present a localised case study of the impacts of seismic lines on proximal boreal forest and wetland ecosystem vegetation structural characteristics. The study concentrates on a relatively undisturbed area of the Oil Sands Region of the Boreal zone in north central Alberta using airborne multi-spectral lidar and publically available geospatial data. The results of this study indicate that significant variations in adjacent forest/wetland edge vegetation structure occur proximal to 30 seismic lines identified within the study area. The variations observed in this area depend on the environmental characteristics of the seismic lines. Often taller trees and greater fractional cover extends to a distance of up to 55 m from the seismic line, especially in land covers adjacent to wider seismic lines. Random forest analysis of spatial correspondence between environmental and proximity based variability associated with seismic lines indicates that distance, incident radiation and the potential for accumulation of surface water based on local geomorphology (inferred from topographic position) are the most important variables affecting height and fractional cover of proximal vegetation. Combined variables including distance from the seismic line, width of the seismic line, cardinal direction and incident radiation, topographic position and underlying surface geology may be used to predict spatial variability of vegetation height to an accuracy of 70% (adjusted (adj.) R-2). From this research, we suggest continued sampling testing of lidar/high resolution optical imagery and geospatial data to examine the impacts of seismic lines in other parts of the Oil Sands Region using the methods developed in this case study. Reclamation management plans for oil and gas exploration areas should focus on reclaiming wider seismic lines first as these have the greatest impact on proximal ecosystems.","2019-03-25","2025-03-21 20:02:18","2025-03-22 17:05:13","","1601-1613","","","658","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000456175700148","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper uses LiDAR to evaluate the effect of seismic lines on surrounding vegetation in the Alberta oil sands.</p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; linear disturbance; linear feature; seismic lines; vegetation; vascular plants; remote sensing; LiDAR; mineral exploration; surface water/runoff; woody plants; landscape conversion/fragmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of our study was to examine and compare the influence of oil sands process water (OSPW) and material (fine fluid tails or FFT) on the plant community composition of created wetlands. Compared to created-unamended and natural wetlands, the created wetlands amended with OSPW and/or FFT (created-tailings wetlands) had significantly higher water salinity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration and lower oxidative-reductive potential. Water chemistry parameters of created-unamended did not differ significantly from those of natural wetlands. The sediment of created wetlands had significantly less moisture, total nitrogen, and organic content than the natural wetlands. The application of OSPW/FFT in created wetlands will likely lead to initial vegetation composition atypical of natural regional wetlands. For the objective of reclaiming vegetation composition to the status of natural regional wetlands, unamended wetlands were the best reclamation option, based on the physical and chemical parameters measured. Despite being the favored reclamation option, created-unamended wetlands' physical and chemical characteristics remain atypical of natural wetlands. Most significantly, the basin morphometry of created wetlands was significantly different from that of naturally-formed wetlands in the region, and this appears to partly explain difference in vegetation composition. We also demonstrate that species richness alone is not a useful measure in wetland monitoring. Instead, plant community composition is a better indicator of wetland conditions.","2016-05-01","2025-03-21 20:02:18","2025-03-22 18:09:37","","18-28","","","172","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000374079900004","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the changes in vegetation in wetlands created to receive process waters from oil sand processing in Alberta.</p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; on-site restoration; vegetation; other wetland; mitigation hierarchy; hydrocarbons; salinity; physiography; fertility change/contamination; treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Canada, anthropogenic disturbance from energy exploration has undermined the capacity of peatlands to support these vital ecosystem services, and thus presents the need for their reclamation to a functional ecosystem. As attempts are now being made to implement reclamation plans on post-mining oil sands landscapes, a major challenge remains in the absence of a standard framework for evaluating the functional state of a constructed peatland. To address this challenge, we present a functional-based approach that can guide the evaluation of constructed peatlands in the Alberta oil sands region. We achieved this by conducting a brief review, which synthesized the dominant processes of peatland functional development in natural analogues. Through the synthesis, we identified the interaction and feedback processes that underline various peatland ecosystem functions and their quantifiable variables. By exploring the mechanism of key ecosystem interactions, we highlighted the sensitivity of microbially mediated biogeochemical processes to a range of variability in other ecosystem functions, and thus the appropriateness of using them as functional indicators of ecosystem condition. Following the verification of this concept through current pilot fen reclamation projects, we advocate the need for further research towards modification to a more cost-efficient approach that can be applicable to large-scale fen reclamation projects in this region.","2015-04","2025-03-21 20:02:18","2025-03-22 18:11:55","","211-225","","2","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000351532700001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the development of hydrological and biogeochemical functions in fens constructed for mine reclamation in the Alberta oil sands region. </p> </div>","","","Canada; biogeochemistry; hydrology; peatland; mining; mine reclamation; fen; mine planning; wetland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this has resulted in increased construction on peatlands and wetlands and has led to diverse environmental impacts in the affected areas. The overall aim of this project was to review the effectiveness of standard mitigation measures used during construction to maintain the hydrological conditions within peat soils and wetland habitats. This work involved a literature review of the evidence of the impacts of construction on the habitat and groundwater in groundwater-dependent wetlands and peatlands. In addition, developers and contractors were consulted to gain feedback on what practical approaches have and have not been successful and remedial actions taken when monitoring or observation identifies ongoing issues. This research also developed regulatory-relevant recommendations. The main recommendation focuses on the central importance of collecting relevant and detailed site investigation data at an early stage of the application process to enable a full understanding of the site character and to inform a more accurate design process. This will reduce or avoid impacts on the environment, minimise risk, and produce a more informed construction strategy.","2024","2025-03-22 17:20:44","2025-03-22 18:44:32","","","","17","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the best practices to minimize construction impacts to peatlands and other wetlands.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; best management practices; linear disturbance; other wetland; substrate disturbance; groundwater; impact minimization; roads; mitigation hierarchy; surface water/runoff; vegetation disturbance; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper discusses the challenges related to design, construction, and operation of pipes in potentially compressible soils such as peat and organic soils in British Columbia. It provides mitigation measures to manage the pipe concerns related to these soils. Among the design challenges discussed are geotechnical characterization of potentially unstable soil sites and special pipe trench design and foundation alternatives to minimize pipe settlement and localized stresses. To demonstrate the impact of adjacent soil fill or embankment loading on pipe integrity, soil deformation finite element analyses are carried out for various scenarios representing different unstable soil profiles, surface loading configurations, and offsets from the pipe alignment.

The adsorption characteristics of heavy metals (Pb, Cu, and Cd) by peat moss-derived biochars produced under different carbonization conditions were investigated by a series of batch experiments. Biochars were produced by the pyrolysis of peat moss over a temperature range of 400-1000 degrees C for 30-90 min. Biochar produced at 800 degrees C for 90 min was the most efficient for the removal of Pb and Cu, when weight loss ratio was considered. The pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models adequately described kinetics and isotherms, respectively, of heavy metal adsorption on peat moss-derived biochar, indicating that heavy metal ions were chemically adsorbed on the adsorption sites as uniform monolayer. The peat moss-derived biochar showed the highest maximum adsorption capacity for Pb (81.3 mg/g), followed by Cd and Cu, which were 39.8 and 18.2 mg/g, respectively.

Different approaches were developed and used to analyze WT changes (mean WT position, WT fluctuation, WT hydrograph, recession, and storage characteristics). Restoration increased WT in most cases but particularly in spruce mires, followed by pine mires and fens. Before restoration, the WT fluctuation (WTF) was large, indicating peat temporary storage gain (SG). After restoration, the WT hydrograph recession limb slopes and SG coefficients (Rc) declined significantly. Drainage or restoration did not significantly affect mean diurnal WT fluctuations, used here as a proxy for evapotranspiration. Overall, the changes in WT characteristics following restoration indicated creation of favorable hydrological conditions for recovery of functional peatland ecosystems in previously degraded peatland sites. This was supported by calculation of bryophyte species abundance thresholds for WT. These results can be used to optimize restoration efforts in different peatland systems and as a qualitative conceptual basis for future restoration operations.","2016-05-01","2025-05-26 15:04:13","2025-05-26 15:10:42","2025-05-26","3742-3760","","5","52","","Water Resources Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of rewetting of 24 forestry-drained peatlands as compared to 19 pristine peatlands in Scandinavia.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; water table; drawdown; rewetting; bryophytes; sphagnum; evapotranspiration; forest harvest; mitigation hierarchy; ditching; surface water/runoff; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a replicated BACIPS (Before-After-Control-Impact Paired Series) design, we investigated 24 peatlands, all drained for forestry and subsequently restored, and 19 pristine control boreal peatlands with high temporal and spatial resolution data on hydroclimate and pore water quality. In drained conditions, total nitrogen (Ntot), total phosphorus (Ptot), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore water were several-fold higher than observed at pristine control sites, highlighting the impacts of long-term drainage on pore water quality. In general, pore water DOC and Ntot decreased after restoration measures but still remained significantly higher than at pristine control sites, indicating long time lags in restoration effects. Different peatland classes and trophic levels (vegetation gradient) responded differently to restoration, primarily due to altered hydrology and varying acidity levels. Sites that were hydrologically overrestored (inundated) showed higher Ptot, Ntot, and DOC than well-restored or insufficiently restored sites, indicating the need to optimize natural-like hydrological regimes when restoring peatlands drained for forestry.

There is great uncertainty about how catchment hydrological processes change after restoration, with a particular lack of well-documented catchment runoff data. This study compared five formerly Disturbed (now Restored) and two undisturbed peatlands. In total, 455 and 728 hydrological events were selected for the analysis, using a three-event selection technique. Mean event runoff coefficient (RC) values varied greatly between conditions and hydrological events. RC in Disturbed conditions was slightly higher than in undisturbed conditions, but RC in Restored conditions was higher than under other conditions. Mean transit time revealed that event rainfall water reached the outlet faster in Disturbed conditions. Mean event peak flow in Disturbed conditions was higher and peaked faster than under other conditions. However, the base flow showed no noticeable difference between treatments. Significantly higher watertable (WT) rise per rainfall input (0.36?0.85 cm/mm) was observed in Disturbed conditions, due to lower specific yield (Sy) values (0.13?0.24) than under Restored and undisturbed conditions (Sy 0.25?0.50). Shallow WT showed significant positive correlations with runoff and storage properties and was a key component of the runoff generation mechanisms in peatlands. Storage-related parameters (Sy, WT rise per rainfall input) and catchment response time parameters revealed disturbance-related hydrological changes in peatlands more clearly than other runoff parameters tested (e.g., RC). Overall, with restoration, WT and storage properties recovered to the levels at undisturbed sites but increased runoff was observed occasionally due to wetter antecedent moisture conditions.","2018-07-01","2025-05-26 15:19:03","2025-11-04 19:44:18","2025-05-26","4479-4497","","7","54","","Water Resources Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines how drawdown versus rewetting affects the runoff hydrology in peatlands managed for forest harvest in Finland.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; water table; drawdown; rewetting; forest harvest; landform; surface water/runoff; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Timescales of monitoring studies in ditch-drained and restored peatlands are typically limited to a few years, and occasionally decades. In addition, experimental studies seldom monitor spatial changes in peat structure caused by ditches, despite such changes affecting water flow and water retention in peat. Ecosystem models offer an alternative to experimental studies and can help explain how complex systems such as peatlands may respond to external disturbances. Here we report on a 2-D application of a peatland development model (DigiBog) to explore how contour-parallel ditches, and their damming, affect the ecohydrology of peatlands over decades to centuries, using blanket peatlands as a case study. Drainage resulted in the rapid loss of peat due to increased oxic decay. The majority of these losses occurred in the first 100 years after the ditch was created, but water table dynamics were altered even centuries later. Restoration halted the loss of peat and encouraged net peat accumulation, although the amount lost in 100 years of drainage had not been replaced 200 years after the ditch was dammed. Restoration of ditches in sloping peatlands brought about more peat regrowth downslope of the restored ditch than further upslope. Our study demonstrates the potential for spatially distributed ecosystem-scale models as tools to explore complex spatiotemporal responses to disturbance, and to support land managers in making decisions about peatland drainage and restoration.","2017-08-01","2025-05-26 15:19:31","2025-11-10 20:52:28","2025-05-26","6510-6522","","8","53","","Water Resources Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper simulates the century-scale impacts of restoration after drainage on the hydrology of peatlands.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; decomposition; drawdown; rewetting; carbon cycle; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study aimed to examine the influence of long-term drainage and rewetting of peatlands on smallscale spatial variability of the soil chemical properties and enzyme activities. We collected 400 soil samples from the 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm soil depths of a drained and a corresponding rewetted peatland. The number of grid cells was 100 for each of the drained and the rewetted peatland, and the size of each grid cell was 3 m x 3 m. We analyzed 17 soil parameters from the surfaces and 14 from the subsurface of both sites. The variability (range, SD, and CV) of all the soil properties was higher in the drained peatland than in the restored peatlands except for the soil pH. The geostatistical analysis revealed only the soil pH, acid phosphatase, -glucosidase, and arylsulfatase activities disclosed the strong spatial dependency at the 5 m semivariance range in the drained peatland. However, more than 80% of the soil properties showed a strong spatial dependence within the 4 to 20 m semivariance ranges in the restored peatland. The strong spatial dependencies of all the soil properties in the long-term restored peatland conclusively call for the spatial soil sampling and geostatistical data analysis methods to capture substantial spatial variability that has important implications in degraded peatland restoration.","2022","2025-07-09 20:29:09","2025-11-04 20:55:05","","","","","Volume 10 - 2022","","Frontiers in Environmental Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines in detail the changes that occur in soils of drained versus rewetted peatlands in Germany.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; peatland; on-site restoration; peat; microbial activity; nutrients; pH; drawdown; rewetting; mitigation hierarchy; substrate; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After three growing seasons, it was found that bryophytes (excluding sphagna) were the main strata benefiting from P fertilization. Mosses like Polytrichum strictum showed positive responses to P addition, provided that the rewetting was optimal and that these bryophytes were present in the donor site. The optimal dose of phosphate rock (PR) to encourage plant re-establishment appears to be in the range of 15–25gPRm−2. Fertilization timing should be investigated further as applications would probably have more impact during periods of high nutrient uptake by target plants in establishment phase than before or after other restoration steps.

It investigates three restored wetlands in the forest of Gribskov and whether or not the restoration has been successful in bringing the wetlands back to historical, pre-ditching conditions. The historical conditions are investigated by analysing 19th century maps and by identifying peat in soil samples along transects. The current conditions are investigated through a current forest map and a GIS-based rain fill-model that identifies local depressions in the landscape, as well as measuring ground water depth in the field. The maps used for this study are also held up against each other and compared with the results of the field study to determine how well the delineation fits with the actual measured border of the wetlands. An inclination analysis of the landscape surrounding the three restored wetlands was also made bya combination of field- and map studies for investigating whether or not the border of wetlands areaffected by the topography of the surface. The map study was also done to investigate the timing and intensity of the management actions that have led to the steep decline of wetlands in the whole of Gribskov through time, as well as theopposite trend in recent years. An additional aspect of the field study dealt with the composition of soil horizons of the samples across the transects and across the three cases, revealing in what way soil constitutes change withincreasing distance to a wetland. It was found that all three studied cases seem to have been hydrologically well restored, as the correlation between a shallow depth of ground water and presence of peat was high, indicating that the border of the wetland is situated approximately at the same location currently as it did historically. The inclination analysis was inconclusive, but vaguely supports the idea that topography do affect wetland borders. Method development is needed in order to reach more conclusive results in this matter. Historical ditching was found to have had a great effect on the decline of wetlands, and modern restoration projects also seem to be an effective measure of bringing the wetlands back. Lastly, the soil samples consistently showed a decrease of peat with increasing distance to blankwater and an increase of inorganic mineral soil with increasing distance.","2022-06-28","2025-07-09 21:04:15","2025-09-26 14:34:17","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Copenhagen","Copenhagen","","","M.Sc.","","","","","DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.22749.69601","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This thesis examines the effects of ditch blocking and rewetting on the recovery of hydrological conditions in forested peatlands in Denmark ditched for sylviculture.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; peat; water table; drawdown; rewetting; forest harvest; landform; ditching; physiography; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These species were incubated in both a restoration site (harvested fen) and an undisturbed fen to compare decomposition according to different environmental conditions. The average exponential decay coefficient (k) for all material types was slightly higher (circa 0.04·y−1 higher) in the harvested fen than those observed in the undisturbed fen. However, the litter type (leaves, roots/rhizomes, or bryophyte fragments) had the largest impact on the decomposition rates. The 2 tested bryophytes had lower k-values (between 0.14 and 0.11 for Polytrichum strictum and 0.06 for Sphagnum centrale) than the vascular plant litter (between 0.25 and 0.50). The annual primary production of the tested species was also measured to estimate the peat-accumulating capacity of each species. Scirpus cyperinus had an annual primary production that was 3 times higher (1500 g·m−2.y−1) than the other species (between 300 and 550 g·m−2.y−1).

Due to the low number of well-replicated field studies, the extent to which restoration recovers plant communities, and the factors underlying possible shortcomings, are not well understood even in medium term. We compared the plant community composition of 38 sites comprising pristine, forestry-drained, and 5 or 10 years ago restored peatlands in southern Finland, with special interest in understanding spatial variation within studied sites, as well as the development of the numbers and the abundances of target species. Our results indicated a recovery of community composition 5?10 years after restoration, but there was significant heterogeneity in recovery. Plant communities farthest away from ditches were very similar to their pristine reference already 10 years after restoration. In contrast, communities in the ditches were as far from the target as the drained communities. The recovery appears to be characterized by a decline in the number and abundance of species typical to degraded conditions, and increase in the abundance of characteristic peatland species. However, we found no increase above the drained state in the number of characteristic peatland species. Our results suggest that there is a risk of drawing premature conclusions on the efficiency of ecological restoration with the current practice of short-term monitoring. Our results also illustrate fine-scale within-site spatial variability in the degradation and recovery of the plant communities that should be considered when evaluating the success of restoration. Overall, we find the heterogeneous outcome of restoration observed here promising. However, low recovery in the number of characteristic species demonstrates the importance of prioritizing restoration sites, and addressing the uncertainty of recovery when setting restoration targets. It appears that it is easier to eradicate unwanted species than regain characteristic species by restoration.","2017-10-01","2025-07-09 21:10:17","2025-09-26 18:09:33","2025-07-09","7848-7858","","19","7","","Ecology and Evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the recovery of vegetation after rewetting following drainage for forestry.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; water table; drawdown; rewetting; monitoring; forest harvest; woody plants; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We addressed this lack of knowledge by investigating a peatland in south-west Germany that was partly rewetted 20 years ago. A successfully restored site and a moderately drained site were compared, where the mean groundwater levels were close to the soil surface and around 30cm below surface, respectively. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at 4 depths were measured over one year. The specific absorbance was measured at 280nm and the fluorescence spectra were used to describe the aromaticity and complexity of DOM. The investigations showed that 20 years of peatland restoration was able to create typical peatland conditions. The rewetted site had significantly lower DOC concentrations at different depths compared to the drained site. The specific UV absorbance showed that the rewetted site had a lower level of aromatic DOM structures. The decreasing specific UV absorbance might indicate an increasing contribution of small organic molecules to DOM. It was hypothesized that the decreasing DOC concentrations and the relative enrichment of small, readily degradable organic molecules, reflect the slower decomposition of organic matter after the re-establishment of the water table. Seasonal trends provided substantial evidence for our hypothesis that reduced DOC concentrations were caused by reduced peat decomposition. During summer, the elevated DOC values were accompanied by an increase in DOM aromaticity and complexity. Our results demonstrated a close link between C mineralization and DOC production. We concluded that long-term peatland restoration in the form of the successful re-establishment of the water table might result in reduced peat decomposition and lower DOC concentrations. The restoration of peatlands seems to have a positive impact on C sequestration.","2009-12-15","2025-07-09 21:20:16","2025-09-26 20:49:54","","78-83","","1","408","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- &nbsp;This paper examines how dissolved organic carbon shifts within peat profiles two decades after rewetting of &nbsp;the peat substrate.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; decomposition; peat; substrate disturbance; water table; carbon sequestration; drawdown; rewetting; carbon cycle; dissolved organic carbon; mitigation hierarchy; substrate; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used the national inventory data from 64 milled peatlands in Estonia, distributed over the region of 300???200?km. This is the first national-scale statistical evaluation of abandoned extracted peatlands. During surveys, vascular plants, bryophytes, and residual peat properties were recorded on three microtopographic forms: flats, ditch margins, and ditches. The microtopography was the main factor distinguishing the composition of plant communities on flats and ditches, while ditch margins resembled flats. The extracted indicator species suggested two successional pathways, toward fen or raised bog community. A single indicator trait?the depth of residual peat, which combines the information about peat properties (e.g. pH, ash content, and trophicity status), predicted the plant community succession in microtopographic habitats. We suggest that peatland management plans about the cost-efficient restoration of abandoned peat mining areas should consider properties of residual peat layer as the baseline indicator: milled peatfields with thin (<2.3?m) and well-decomposed residual peat should be restored toward fen vegetation types, whereas sites with thick (>2.3?m) and less decomposed residual peat layer should be restored toward transitional mires or raised bogs.

Biodiversity is ‘the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems’ (CBD 1992). Most of the ecosystem services provided by natural peatlands depend ultimately on living organisms, and individual species may directly deliver provisioning and cultural services. In recent years, peatlands have repeatedly been identified by the Ramsar Convention as the most important wetland type for the support of biodiversity and the regulation of natural processes. They also have been singled out for increased attention by both the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Nonetheless, the importance of peatlands for biodiversity is still poorly understood among many audiences.In this chapter, we outline the biodiversity characteristics of natural peatlands and the suitability of different methods for their assessment (Section 3.2), consider how biodiversity is lost and how losses may be quantified (Section 3.3) and explore some implications for the development of effective approaches to the restoration of peatland biodiversity based on the principles of structural-functional ecosystem analysis (Section 3.4). Biodiversity in natural peatlands Characteristics of peatland habitats and speciesThe process of peat formation means that part of the peatland biota is directly responsible for creating the habitat (Minayeva et al. 2008). Mire massifs form distinct habitat patches that may be spatially separated by large distances, and are characterised by:• high water level and moisture content• considerable fluctuations of surface temperature• low oxygen content• accumulation of toxic substances and absorbed gases• limited availability of nutrients• higher acidity than surrounding ecosystems (in most cases).These conditions create severe restrictions for living organisms, resulting in intense competition for space and nutrients between individuals even if they have different life forms. Peatlands also influence driving factors (water level, microclimate, matter and water balance, gas exchange, etc.) that affect habitat conditions, and thus biodiversity, for non-peatland ecosystems in the surrounding landscape and downstream.","2016","2025-07-09 21:29:34","2025-11-04 20:18:42","","44-62","","","","","","","Ecological Reviews","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","","","","Cambridge Core","","Cambridge University Press","","DOI: 10.1017/CBO9781139177788.004","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents a general overview of peatlands and their restoration with a focus on European peatlands.</p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; ecosystem services; biodiversity","","Bonn, Aletta; Allott, Tim; Evans, Martin; Joosten, Hans; Stoneman, Rob","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Majority of these peatlands, however, are altered by the drainage for the agriculture, forestry and peat extraction that has led to a degradation of peatland ecosystems, and declined their functioning. The rapid loss of peatland habitats, subsidence of peat soils and carbon emissions after water level drawdown have highlighted the need for the ecological restoration of drained peatlands. Although the first restoration attempts in the early 2000s in Estonia covered only minor areas, the current increase of restoration projects in quantity and quality has been promising, and the aim to restore 10,000 ha of degraded sites in Estonia for 2020 is likely to be implemented.","2018","2025-07-15 14:19:29","2025-10-24 13:29:54","","342-349","","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the peatlands in Estonia and presents an overview of their restoration progress and research directions on restoration. </p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; drawdown; rewetting; forest harvest; mitigation hierarchy; agriculture; ditching; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Europe, the requirements for conservation, restoration and long-term sustainability of degraded active bog have been accentuated by more stringent environmental policy and legislation. This paper describes how peat bunds (dams), strategically constructed at affected areas around the bog margins, can gradually re-establish the natural peatland hydrology and peat-forming vegetation through collection, storage and controlled release of surface runoff from the high bog. For geotechnical stability, the translational-type slip failure was identified as the critical case. The analysis must account for drying out of the compacted peat during drought periods and ensuing increases in lateral and uplift hydraulic pressures and seepage pressures generated following torrential rainfall events. Various geotechnical issues, including how much the current soil mechanics framework, standard strength-measurement procedures and ways of evaluating pertinent parameters should be used in describing fibrous peat behavior, are also described. Finally, subsidence and/or restoration of peatland may occur over protracted time periods, making monitoring a challenge. In this regard, airborne LiDAR scanning and geophysical techniques provide rapid, economical topographic and depth profiling in peatlands, with the latter also providing engineering-property characterization, to augment conventional GPS surveying, auger and penetrometer methods.","2019","2025-07-15 14:23:48","2025-11-04 21:00:32","","1-15","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents the geotechnical considerations for bund structures to restore peatlands in the UK.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; bog; peat; water table; remote sensing; monitoring; geotechnical properties; mitigation hierarchy; peat dams; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the latter two sites, operations had ceased 2 and 7 years prior to this study, respectively. The water table dropped to a maximum depth of 40, 50, and 68 cm, respectively, at the undisturbed, 2-year, and 7-year abandoned sites and a resulted in subsidence of 0.96, 3.84, and 2.65 cm m?1, respectively. At the undisturbed site, surface elevation changes did not always correspond to water table changes, but peat underwent a period of swelling even as the water table fell, probably due to the accumulation of methane in soil pores. At all sites most volume change occurred in the upper 50 cm layer, with maximum strain of 5, 15, and 5% at the undisturbed, 2-year, and 7-year abandoned sites, respectively, and was strongly related to water table decline. A model of peat deformation in the zone of saturation (100 cm depth), based on changes in saturated soil moisture (6%), grossly overestimated strain (1%) in the saturated zone, and again methane accumulation was the suspected cause of the soil moisture decrease. Peat compression (and perhaps methane accumulation) caused hydraulic conductivity to decrease over two orders of magnitude at 75, 125, and 170 cm depth. The decrease in hydraulic conductivity as a peatland dries may be an important self-preservation mechanism (i.e., against further water loss).","2003-09-01","2025-07-15 19:31:55","2025-11-10 14:25:05","2025-07-15","1241","","9","39","","Water Resources Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the effects of drawdown on peatland hydrology and peat deformation in extracted peatlands in Québec.</p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; bog; peat; water table; drawdown; substrate; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Restoration and rewetting can help prevent these emissions, while continuous monitoring is critical for evaluating their success. Using satellite-derived observations of essential climate variables, we conducted the first large-scale assessment of how peatland restoration influences land surface temperature (LST), albedo, and vegetation across 72 sites in North America and Europe. Our findings indicated that before restoration, degraded peatlands had a commonly lower daytime LST and albedo but higher nighttime LST, leaf area index (LAI), and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) compared to intact sites. The largest restoration-induced absolute values of monthly changes reached +3.18 °C (daytime LST), −1.22 °C (nighttime LST), −2.54 (LAI), −0.29 (FPAR), and −0.16 (albedo). While restored peatlands tended to align more closely with intact sites a decade after restoration began, the probability of this alignment varied depending on the climate variables. Restored peatlands became more similar than different to intact sites in nighttime LST and albedo after a post-restoration decade, with high similarity projected within five decades. Peatland restoration modifies local and regional climate and should be included in future climate projections.","2025-07-08","2025-07-18 16:19:26","2025-09-05 16:48:07","","084037","","8","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IOP Publishing","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This study examines the effects of peatland restoration in North American and Europe on their albedo, surface temperature and vegetation using remote sensing. </p> </div>","","","Canada; energy balance; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; soil temperature; substrate disturbance; remote sensing; satellite imagery; rewetting; monitoring; vegetation disturbance; climate; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The restoration aimed to return the trajectory of vegetation succession toward that of undisturbed systems through the blockage of ditches and the removal of trees. Permanent plots established on a bog and a fen were sampled 1 year before, and 1, 2, 3, and 10 years after the restoration. The restoration resulted in a long-term rise of the water-table in both peatlands. Ten years after restoration, the mineral element concentrations (Ca, K, Mg, Mn, and P) of peat corresponded to those reported from comparable pristine peatlands. In particular, the increase of K and Mn concentrations at both sites suggests the recovery of ecosystem functionality in terms of nutrient cycling between peat and plants. The restoration resulted in the succession of plant communities toward the targeted peatland vegetation of wetter condition at both sites. This was evident from the decreased abundance of species benefiting from drainage and the corresponding increase of peatland species. However, many species typical of pristine peatlands were missing 10 years after restoration. We conclude that the restoration led to a reversal of the effects of drainage in vegetation and studied habitat conditions. However, due to the slow recovery of peatland ecosystems and the possibility that certain failures in the restoration measures may become apparent only after extended time periods, long-term monitoring is needed to determine whether the goals of restoration will be met.","2011-09-01","2025-07-31 12:59:07","2025-09-26 18:13:30","2025-07-31","587-598","","5","19","","Restoration Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of rewetting of peatlands drained for forestry on the return of peatland vegetation.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; hydrology; peatland; vegetation; bog; nutrients; water table; drawdown; rewetting; fen; forest harvest; woody plants; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article presents the 5-y time trend of soil and surface water quality observed in a drainage experiment conducted in a black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) peatland of eastern Québec, Canada, using the paired watershed approach. Nutrient content of peat soil water was enhanced by drainage. The effect was generally proportional to ditch closeness for S and Mg, while increases of N, Na, K and Ca were mainly observed within 5m of the ditches, even though high levels of K and Ca were occasionally observed at 15-m distance. Drainage increased and sustained summer low flows by 25% through a 80m3d−1 increase of base flow on the 8ha basin. The concentration of suspended sediments significantly increased and exceeded acceptable limits for aquatic organisms only during ditching and during the peak flows of the following weeks. No effect on suspended sediments was detected during the spring following ditching but an increase was observed during a storm 2y after ditching. Drainage modified the basin outflow temperature fluctuations by lowering the average weekly minimum and increasing the maximum, by 2°C and 7°C, respectively. Water temperature increases to 25°C or more at the outlet of the drained basin were above the preferred range for brook trout. The treatment significantly increased specific conductivity of surface water, which was clearly related to increases in mineral N (NH4+NOx), Ca, Mg, Na and S concentrations. However, conductivity and the increased nutrient concentrations remained within the acceptable criteria for aquatic organisms. Drainage also produced a pH increase of one unit, a result attributed to increased runoff from the upland part of the treated watershed. No effect related to drainage was found for Zn, Fe and Al contents.","1999-01-01","2025-07-31 13:03:32","2025-11-10 14:22:24","","130-143","","1","214","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects of the ditching and drawdown of the water table in forested peatlands on water quality and water flow.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; nutrients; water table; drawdown; water quality; sediment; forest harvest; Canada warbler; ditching; sulphur compounds; fertility change/contamination; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the basis of geological cross-sections, a hydrological model applying the Boussinesq-equation has been developed to investigate the hydrological dynamics of the study area and to evaluate various management strategies. Modelled water levels corresponded well to measured ones. The optimised values of two of the main model parameters—the hydraulic conductivity and the proportions of vegetation types—agreed with measurement values, and, respectively, the real vegetation cover, while the third one, the specific yield, should pragmatically be used as a calibration parameter. Due to a proportion of around 30% of tall fen vegetation, the modelled evapotranspiration clearly exceeded grass evapotranspiration resulting in low groundwater levels in some parts of the fen during summer. Generally, the water levels are controlled by topographic features (i.e. former peat cuttings) and weather conditions during the summer months. When analyzing different management scenarios, even an optimal water supply (ditch water levels near the ground surface) could not raise the groundwater table to ecologically sound levels during summer. However, during winter, these ditch water levels enhanced flooding. The groundwater fluxes towards the river, and, respectively, towards the fen were low. The minor importance of these fluxes for the water balance was caused by very low hydraulic gradients. Therefore, it can be concluded that the risk of nutrient export from the fen into the river is very limited and compound transformations take place within the mire system itself. Hydrological analysis as a prerequisite for the assessment of nutrient and pollutant transport and transformation processes can be carried out—as a first approach—with simple models on the basis of a limited dataset.","2006-06-30","2025-07-31 13:04:24","2025-11-10 22:23:34","","376-389","","1","325","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that simple model based on limited data sets can provide meaningful results for monitoring rewetted peatlands.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; nutrients; groundwater; water table; drawdown; rewetting; monitoring; evapotranspiration; fen; surface water/runoff; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; Fen; Re-wetting; Water management; Wetland hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sphagnum diaspores (fragments) and straw mulch were spread over the excavated surfaces, a control peat field, and a mulch-protected site without basins. Mean water tables in the 20-, 10-, and 4-m wide basins and the mulch-protected site were 27.2, 8.3, 11.4, and 9.7 cm higher, respectively, than in the control peat field in May to August 1996. Similar improvements were observed in 1997 (a drier summer). The higher water table was due to lowering of the peat surface with respect to the local water table, retention of meltwater and stormwater by the peripheral ridges formed during excavation, retention of water during drier periods by the groundwater mound beneath the ridges, and mulch. Soil moisture was always higher in the experimental basins than in the control peat field or in the mulch-protected site, demonstrating the superior soil wetness characteristic of sites with basins and straw mulch. Water tension data signaled the absence of the capillary fringe (i.e., capillary drainage) near the surface for some finite period, thus possibly limiting water for best Sphagnum growth. At the experimental basins and mulch-protected site, 100% of these periods lasted four or fewer days. In the control peat field, 20% of the periods when capillary drainage had occurred lasted more than four days, with one period of 17 days. The mulch protection alone provided considerable improvement in hydrological conditions compared with the control peat field, but the additional water retained in the experimental basins protected against Sphagnum desiccation and loss during more extreme dry periods.","2002-06-01","2025-09-02 19:32:26","2025-11-10 18:42:29","","259-266","","","10","","Restoration Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the use of shallow basins to increase soil moisture for the restoration of post-extraction peatlands using the moss layer transfer technique.</p> </div>","","","Canada; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; peat; substrate disturbance; water table; soil moisture; drawdown; rewetting; bryophytes; sphagnum; vegetation disturbance; substrate; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microbial assemblages serve as valuable indicators for monitoring environmental change and assessing the success of ecosystem restoration efforts. Testate amoebae are a group of unicellular shelled protists that are commonly used for Holocene palaeohydrological reconstruction in peatlands. While progress is being made, the use of testate amoebae for biomonitoring in peatland restoration is still in its early stages. The aim of this study is to assess testate amoebae response to restoration measures (drain blocking) across three lowland raised bogs in Northern Ireland. To accomplish this, Sphagnum samples were collected from each site using a before-after control-impact (BACI) experimental design. After peatland drainage ditches were blocked, subtle yet significant responses in testate amoebae were observed: (1) key unambiguous wet-indicator taxa became more abundant in samples adjacent to blocked dams; (2) a widespread increase in the abundance of taxa with subspherical tests was observed, most notably in samples near to blocked drains. The findings of this study demonstrate the reliable response of testate amoebae to wetter conditions across all sites after restoration. Functional trait analysis paired with an indicator-taxa based approach, demonstrate the value of testate amoebae as contemporary bioindicators for tracking peatland restoration success, even when detailed hydrological monitoring data is not available. However, testate amoebae should be used with some degree of caution for peatland biomonitoring until long-term assemblage-level response to restoration is better understood.","2025-09","2025-09-04 14:55:37","2025-09-26 14:34:24","","","","","391","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001530579000006","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- &nbsp;This paper demonstrates that testate amoeba microfossil assemblages can be used for biomonitoring of water levels in restored bogs.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; bog; water table; rewetting; monitoring; biomonitoring; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we synthesise the latest evidence for how interactions of drought with Sphagnum affect peatland functioning. We discuss how Sphagnum traits, from the cellular to the community, control its ecohydrology and what changes occur during drought.

Highest germination rates and species richness occurred in saturated substrate, with very little germination in the well-drained treatment. Seed banks were not predictive of post-restoration in situ species richness, but post-restoration vegetation was similarly native, perennial, and wetland-adapted. Restoration increased in situ total plant and wetland-adapted plant species richness compared with pre-restoration, and this richness persisted for multiple years post-restoration.

Nature-based solutions, such as the reintroduction of beavers, have emerged as effective tools for promoting wetland restoration. Whilst the impact of beavers on wetland restoration is well known, their broader influence on ecosystem health, particularly in modifying habitats for other species, remains inadequately understood. Here we assess the impact that habitat modification through the reintroduction of beavers has on bat populations. There were significantly greater activity levels within beaver modified wetland habitats for multiple bat species, including higher activity levels of 393 % for Barbastella barbastellus and 313 % for Plecotus spp.. Additionally, we observed positive effects on bat populations in the woodland habitat surrounding beaver-modified wetland for certain taxa. In the face of escalating challenges posed by climate change and habitat loss, addressing biodiversity loss necessitates a shift toward ecosystemcentric mitigation measures. Our study demonstrates that the reintroduction of keystone species like beavers can re-establish historical facilitative links between aquatic and terrestrial food webs, highlighting the importance of such interventions in fostering the resilience and sustainability of entire ecosystems.","2024-11-15","2025-09-04 14:55:38","2025-09-26 20:53:13","","","","","951","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001307040400001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- &nbsp;This paper demonstrates how the rewetting of landscapes by beaver increases habitat for bats in England.</p> </div>","","","other wetland; rewetting; beaver; fauna; bats; hydrological management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Post-fire peat hydrophobicity can inhibit moss regeneration, thereby decreasing the potential for post-fire carbon sequestration. To investigate how to enhance post-fire recovery we assessed two moss restoration methods (plugs and fragments) in an Alberta poor fen two and three years following wildfire. We first characterized post-fire peat hydrophobicity and moss regeneration in four surface cover types: Severely Burned Feather moss hollows (SB-F), Severely Burned Sphagnum fuscum hummocks (SB-S), Lightly Burned S. fuscum hummocks (LB-S), and Lightly Burned Feather moss lawns (LB-F). Across burn severities, hydrophobicity was high in feather moss and relatively low in Sphagnum moss. Similarly, hydrophobicity increased with depth over the top several centimeters in feather moss, but not in Sphagnum moss surface cover. Peat hydrophobicity appears to limit post-fire regeneration. LB-S was the least hydrophobic of the four treatments and was the only cover type in which Sphagnum moss recovered to >10% surface area, though SB-F had marginal recovery of pioneer moss species. Consequently, we conducted experiments testing the success of moss plugs and fragments of varying moss species at LB-F and SB-F surface covers, which had high hydrophobicity and low post-fire moss recovery. Experimental results indicate that the species type used in transplants is less critical in their survival than the microenvironment into which they are transplanted (i.e., burn severity). Transplant success was slightly higher in plugs than fragments, and larger plug sizes (10-15 cm) were more successful than small plugs (<10 cm). Growth was greater in SB-F than LB-F surface cover, owing to differences in post-fire hydrophobicity, and thus moisture availability. We conclude that in appropriate areas post-fire, peatland management efforts could employ large mixed-moss or Sphagnum moss transplant units while accounting for pre-fire vegetation composition and burn severity to fast-track post-fire moss and ecosystem recovery.","2024-08","2025-09-04 14:55:38","2025-09-08 12:52:01","","","","","205","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001249747900001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper tests the post-fire hydrophobicity of post-fire peatland substrates and tests the use of peatland plugs to restore different peatland vegetation substrates.</p> </div>","","","Canada; fire; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; substrate disturbance; bryophytes; sphagnum; microtopography; vegetation disturbance; substrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Monitoring these environments (e.g., cover of keystone species) is therefore essential to evaluate success. However, existing studies have rarely examined peatland vegetation at fine scales due to its strong spatial heterogeneity and seasonal canopy development. The present study collected centimetre-scale multispectral Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery with a Parrot Sequoia camera (2.8 cm resolution; Parrot Drones SAS, Paris, France) in a temperate peatland over a complete growing season. Supervised classification algorithms were used to map the vegetation at the single-species level, and the Maximum Likelihood classifier was found to perform best at the site level (69% overall accuracy). The classification accuracy increased with the spatial resolution of the input data, and a large reduction in accuracy was observed when employing imagery of >11 cm resolution. Finally, the most accurate classifications were produced using imagery collected during the peak (July-August) or early growing season (start of May). These findings suggest that despite the strong heterogeneity of peatlands, these environments can be mapped at the species level using UAVs. Such an approach would benefit studies estimating peatland carbon emissions or using the cover of keystone species to evaluate restoration projects.","2024-03","2025-09-04 14:55:38","2025-11-10 19:26:24","","","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001192008400001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper describes a method to use high-resolution drones to map plant species in peatlands.</p> </div>","","","peatland; vegetation; remote sensing; monitoring; unmanned aerial vehicle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are three main restoration goals stated in the action plan: 1) limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, 2) climate adaptation and 3) improved ecological condition. Quantifying the outcome of the restoration actions is necessary to evaluate whether the goals of the action plan are met. A vegetation monitoring protocol was suggested before restoration started and has been implemented at five restoration sites. As the peatland restoration effort in Norway is increasing, it is timely to evaluate if the data currently collected can measure peatland restoration outcome. We evaluate the monitoring protocol based on statistical analyses of the data collected at two sites, describe how indicator species can be identified using generalized composition data used as the basis for classifying habitats in Norway (EcoSyst framework), and suggest the way forward for peatland restoration monitoring in Norway. Data collected according to the monitoring protocol can document changes in species composition at restoration sites, but has limitations when the ecological complexity at the sites increases and reference sites are unavailable. We argue that adjusting the monitoring protocol will: 1) facilitate alignment with existing peatland research; 2) connect better with monitoring programs where data is collected applying EcoSyst framework principles; and 3) enable upscaling to cover the wide variation emerging in peatland restoration.","2024-04","2025-09-04 14:55:38","2025-10-24 13:44:13","","","","4","2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001147112300001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the progress in peatland restoration in Norway and presents a critique of monitoring practices, with recommendations for best monitoring. </p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; drawdown; monitoring; vegetation sampling; mitigation hierarchy; ditching; vegetation disturbance; reference conditions; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In two bogs in central and north-east Estonia, we studied the recovery and growth of Sphagnum fuscum, Sphagnum rubellum and Sphagnum medium after cutting of donor sites, in comparison with natural bog sites. On average, the water table was 13.8-17.4 cm higher in spring than in autumn, in both natural and donor sites, and mostly higher in the latter by 1.2-8.1 cm. Shoot length increment, density and weight of capitula of Sphagnum mosses were lower in the donor sites than in natural bog sites. The cover of Sphagnum mosses reached 5-50 % over a period of 3-11 years after cutting, indicating much slower recovery than has been reported previously. Of the Sphagnum species studied, S. fuscum showed better recovery in the donor sites. As the weather was similar in the natural and donor sites and the water table was mostly higher in the donor sites, the growth of Sphagnum mosses is most probably impeded by the combination of interrupted capillary water rise and a more pronounced drought effect in the donor sites. To promote revegetation of donor sites, plant fragments should be cut from the uppermost <10 cm only, and not from the entire area but instead leaving uncut patches or stripes to enable faster spreading of plants. Because of the slow recovery of donor sites, cutting of Sphagnum fragments from natural bogs should be avoided, and sites bordering expanding peat extraction areas should be chosen in preference.","2024","2025-09-04 14:55:38","2025-10-02 21:12:22","","","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001388549700001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the effects cutting and removal sphagnum from donor sites (10 cm) on the natural recovery by sphagnum species in two bogs in Estonia.

Where Sphagnum mosses are cultivated other plant species will also establish and possibly compete with the Sphagnum. The aim of this study was to determine which factors influence vascular plant cover as well as plant species numbers at Sphagnum cultivation sites and to derive recommendations for their management. Two cultivation sites were studied in northwest Germany. One of these was established directly after peat extraction while the other was rewetted seven years prior to establishment. Irrigation ditches for water management were installed at both sites. The cover of vascular plants and the number of plant species present were determined in systematically positioned plots. Six variables were tested for their influence on the assessed data by applying boosted regression tree models. The main factors influencing vascular plant cover at the two Sphagnum cultivation sites were the distance to an irrigation ditch (m), the site (location) and Sphagnum cover (%). The number of species per plot was influenced mainly by Sphagnum cover (%), the distance to an irrigation ditch (m) and the donor species used for initiating the cultivation sites. A sufficient supply of nutrient-poor water and optimal Sphagnum growth can reduce vascular plant cover and the number of plant species potentially present at a site. Insufficient water distribution and uneven Sphagnum establishment lead to inhomogeneous site conditions and thus to a higher number of plant species. The number and cover of plant species at a cultivation site are influenced by the vegetation of the sites' surroundings and the selection of the donor site.","2023-08","2025-09-04 14:55:38","2025-09-08 13:41:07","","449-465","","4","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000983868300001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- &nbsp;This paper examines the controls on vascular plants in sphagnum farming sites, in order to limit vascular plants.

In a post-pastured peatland, 24 experiments were implemented, repeated in more degraded (northern) and more natural (southern) areas. The experiments were combinations of restoration measures, with the introduction of Juniperus brevifolia, Calluna vulgaris, and Sphagnum palustre and the use of management techniques to control herbaceous cover (alien-rich herbaceous cover competing with Sphagnum or peatland natural shrubs): intensive and extensive grazing and grass cutting. Principal response curves and redundancy analyses were used to assess changes in the flora and the physicochemical parameters. Globally there was an increase in Sphagnum cover and a decrease in herbaceous species. This was accompanied by an increase in organic matter and a decrease in nitrogen. In more natural parcels (large artificially divided areas where different experiments were implemented), the most positive tendencies were associated with the combination of J. brevifolia planting and grass cutting. In more degraded areas, treatments had a lower impact, as the results tended to be similar to the control, pointing to an important natural regenerative succession dynamic that overlapped the response to the implemented treatments.","2023-09","2025-09-04 14:55:38","2025-11-04 20:07:33","","","","7","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000982856100001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper tests active restoration techniques to restore peatland plants, especially Sphagnum back to peatlands in the Azores.</p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; vascular plants; peat; nutrients; substrate disturbance; bryophytes; sphagnum; active restoration; passive restoration; agriculture; vegetation disturbance; graminoids; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sphagnum mosses are key species for northern peatland formation and re-introduction is often needed for successful ecohydrological restoration of degraded bogs, but natural sources are scarce and often protected. Micropropagated Sphagnum moss products (BeadaMoss (R)) were developed to alleviate this constraint. This research explored in detail, for the first time, the CGHG fluxes on a cut-over lowland peatland restoration site where micropropagated Sphagnum was introduced to an existing 'nurse crop' of Eriophorum angustifolium, and tested the influence of vegetation maturity. Ecosystem CGHG flux was measured using closed chambers at plot scale in areas of both mature and immature E. angustifolium with and without application of BeadaGelTM Sphagnum, with control plots on bare peat. Studies were conducted over two years of contrasting weather patterns. In Year 1, mean net (CO(2)e) CGHG uptake on vegetated plots was -2.33 (minimum 1.55, maximum -5.55) t ha(-1) yr(-1) with increasing CGHG uptake as vegetation matured. In Year 2, gross photosynthesis reduced significantly during the 2018 summer drought resulting in a small mean net CGHG emission of 0.11 (minimum 2.21 maximum -1.22) t ha(-1) yr(-1). Sphagnum application within immature vegetation resulted in greater CGHG uptake in both years, but was not as beneficial within mature vegetation. CGHG emission from bare peat (3.79 t ha(-1) yr(-1) overall) showed the magnitude of avoided losses. Methane flux contributed significantly to CGHG emission but was not closely related to water table depth. Application of Sphagnum within E. angustifolium can deliver good CGHG flux results in the early stages of degraded lowland bog recovery but cannot fully mitigate vulnerability to climate change scenarios.","2023","2025-09-04 14:55:38","2025-10-02 21:20:40","","","","","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001130290800001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the greenhouse gas relations in a restored peatland fragment and the role of graminoid vegetation in helping with establishment of sphagnum microfragments. </p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; bog; greenhouse gases; water table; drawdown; rewetting; carbon cycle; bryophytes; sphagnum; agriculture; vegetation disturbance; graminoids; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we review the recent literature on the response of degraded and restored peatlands to fire, drought and flood. We find that degraded sites can generally be restored in a way that allows for net carbon sequestration. However, biodiversity, hydrological regime, and peat soil structure are not always fully restored, even after a decade of restoration efforts, potentially weakening ecosystem resilience to future disturbances. As the recovery of degraded peatlands is fundamental to achieving net-zero goals and biodiversity targets, sound science and monitoring efforts are needed to further inform restoration investments and priorities. Restoring degraded peatlands can return them to a state of net carbon sequestration and enhance their ecosystem resilience, highlighting the importance of peatland protection and restoration in climate mitigation, according to a synthesis of evidence from temperate and high latitude peatlands.","2022-09-13","2025-09-04 14:55:38","2025-11-04 19:21:34","","","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000853327600001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the effects of peatland habitat deterioration and subsequent restoration on their ability to adapt under a changing climate as a result of climate change.</p> </div>","","","climate change; fire; on-site restoration; carbon sequestration; flooding; rewetting; carbon cycle; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2003, 3800 hectares of retired cranberry farm became the focus of restoration efforts by the New Jersey Conservation Foundation with the goal of returning much of its 2000 hectares of wetlands to the previous condition as Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thoides) swamp. Two different agricultural strategies had previously been employed throughout the farm: traditional- minimal soil and hydrological modification, and modernized- intensive management with soil replacement and major hydrological modification. During restoration, three different strategies were employed: hydrological restoration only, hydrological restoration with microtopographic modification, and hydrological restoration with microtopographic modification and planting of C. thyoides. The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of these strategies on vegetation establishment a decade after restoration was initiated. Replicate nested quadrats were established at each study site, and vegetation was surveyed in both June and August of 2017. All restoration strategies produced robust plant assemblages with similar diversity and quality to each other and to the reference sites. However, the assemblages were set apart by their unique indicator species. Our results also suggest that planting C. thyoides seedlings may give the species selective advantage in a competitive successional setting. According to NMDS ordination, plant assemblages at restored sites were significantly different from reference sites; only continued monitoring will allow us to determine where their successional paths will lead. This study has important implications for future restoration projects in the New Jersey Pine Barrens and similar ecosystems, especially because the results suggest that as long as hydrological restoration occurs, this can promote the establishment of robust, diverse, and relatively high-quality plant assemblages.","2021-08","2025-09-04 14:55:38","2025-11-10 20:47:04","","897-913","","8","222","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000661057900001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This study reports on restoration experiments to restore cranberry fields back to Atlantic white cedar wetlands.</p> </div>","","","peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; peat; substrate disturbance; rewetting; swamp; mitigation hierarchy; agriculture; vegetation disturbance; substrate; hydrological management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to examine the establishment of Sphagnum on cut-over bog with shallow layers (average 78 cm) of highly decomposed ""black peat"" under different hydrological starting conditions. One of the two study sites in northwestern Germany was established directly after peat extraction, while the other one has been rewetted 7 years prior to its installation. Irrigation ditches were installed on these sites for water management. Sphagnum fragments were introduced and covered with straw mulch or geotextile for protection. The establishment of Sphagnum and the site conditions, including vascular plant growth, were evaluated to determine the supporting and limiting factors for Sphagnum farming under the difficult hydrological conditions of shallow highly decomposed peat (low porosity, low hydraulic conductivity). The cultivation of Sphagnum mosses is possible on shallow layers of highly decomposed peat. Sphagnum growth in cover and carpet thickness was significantly higher at the site that had previously been rewetted and had a thicker layer of residual peat. The areas covered with a geotextile showed significantly lower percentages of Sphagnum cover compared to those covered with straw mulch. While sufficient water quantity and quality are known to be prerequisites for Sphagnum farming, a sufficient peat layer thickness seems to be an additional factor for successful Sphagnum establishment and growth. Maintaining an optimal water table proved to be a challenge for these shallow layers of highly decomposed peat, as the low hydraulic conductivity of the peat has impeded a complete irrigation of the sites. Furthermore, the irrigation effort might need to be increased to compensate for additional water loss into the subsoil. On such sites with difficult hydrological and soil conditions, a favourable microclimate provided by vascular plants and a rewetted surrounding area can promote successful establishment of Sphagnum and can even partially counterbalance effects of a low water table.","2021","2025-09-04 14:55:38","2025-09-26 18:03:49","","","","","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000713320200001","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper presents best practice recommendations for Sphagnum farming on thin, highly decomposed peat substrates. </p> </div>","","","hydrology; best management practices; on-site restoration; vascular plants; peat; substrate disturbance; water table; sphagnum; active restoration; donor site; vegetation disturbance; hydrological management; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(1) Degraded peatland was mapped in 2006 (while it was still a pasture, grazed for over 30 years), and throughout the study period in 2013 (2 years post-abandonment) and 2015 (4 years post-abandonment). The baseline assessment of 2006 revealed that Sphagnum spp. were present in 7% of the area, which pointed at the resilience of the peat ecosystem. After the grazing ceased, Sphagnum cover increased to 17% and 39%, in the next 2 and 4 years respectively post animal removal.

These were monitored between July 2012 and July 2015 (triannual). After 4 years, the formerly degraded peatland showed considerable recovery with a growth of Sphagnum spp. cover as well as other species like Calluna vulgaris, tending to become more similar to semi-natural and natural peatlands.

After an initial colonisation, the mean vegetation cover in grazed plots degraded to 9.4 %, demonstrating that restoration using these methods is impeded by trampling impacts of large herbivores. The vegetation cover and number of indicator species increased annually at the ungrazed site. A significantly greater cover (>85 %) occurred at plots where thick brash (>85 % ground cover) had been topped with GeoJute netting, but plots with only heather brash still reached 56.6 % cover. It provided a suitable seed source and colonising substrate for appropriate local peatbog species, while additional planting of C. vulgaris cuttings did not significantly increase vegetation cover in comparison to unplanted plots.

Beaver have well known effects on hydromorphology through dam construction, but their scope to restore wetland biodiversity in areas degraded by agriculture is largely inferred. Our study presents the first formal monitoring of a planned beaver-assisted restoration, focussing on changes in vegetation over 12 years within an agriculturally-degraded fen following beaver release, based on repeated sampling of fixed plots. Effects are compared to ungrazed exclosures which allowed the wider influence of waterlogging to be separated from disturbance through tree felling and herbivory. After 12 years of beaver presence mean plant species richness had increased on average by 46% per plot, whilst the cumulative number of species recorded increased on average by 148%. Heterogeneity, measured by dissimilarity of plot composition, increased on average by 71%. Plants associated with high moisture and light conditions increased significantly in coverage, whereas species indicative of high nitrogen decreased. Areas exposed to both grazing and waterlogging generally showed the most pronounced change in composition, with effects of grazing seemingly additive, but secondary, to those of waterlogging. Our study illustrates that a well-known ecosystem engineer, the beaver, can with time transform agricultural land into a comparatively species-rich and heterogeneous wetland environment, thus meeting common restoration objectives. This offers a passive but innovative solution to the problems of wetland habitat loss that complements the value of beavers for water or sediment storage and flow attenuation. The role of larger herbivores has been significantly overlooked in our understanding of freshwater ecosystem function; the use of such species may yet emerge as the missing ingredient in successful restoration.

Vegetation can be lost through a combination of human and natural processes, leading to areas of exposed bare peat frequently accompanied by loss of surface moisture due to drainage or gullying. Waters draining such degraded peatlands are likely to have increased levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other nutrients, which can adversely impact the global climate, drinking water supplies and freshwater ecology. Consequently peatland revegetation efforts have become widespread. This paper presents results from a four-year study conducted to monitor the water quality impacts of a bare peat revegetation approach, which used landscape scale application of lime and fertiliser to encourage a grass nurse crop. This study considers an area of severely degraded blanket peat in the UK uplands, with large areas of bare peat prior to revegetation and provides the largest field dataset to date on the effects of this method on catchment run-off waters. Despite concerns that liming could increase DOC concentrations, the revegetation method is not shown to have this effect over the time period, and interestingly results in short term periods of suppression. The mechanism for this novel and unexpected finding merits further investigation and results in reduced DOC concentration, by up to 14 mg/l or 50% of control values, combined with periods of reduced colour carbon ratios. The data show that other nutrients were largely unaffected although rates of phosphate (PO43-) export were above recommended levels in the first year of application, suggesting initial phosphorus (P) application rates may require adjustment. Further investigation is required to consider the longer term effects of this restoration method as the vegetation matures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting growth includes both mosses and vascular plants, which are important contributors to returning a peatland to a net carbon-storing ecosystem. Nitrous oxide (N2O) flux has not been widely investigated in these restored ecosystems. We compared the N2O flux from plots containing a vascular plant, Eriophorum vaginatum, to plots lacking vascular plant cover at a recently restored peatland. We hypothesized that E. vaginatum would result in decreased N2O emissions compared to areas with only moss or bare peat due to rapid plant uptake of peat nitrogen. After an early-summer pulse of emitted N2O, study plots containing E. vaginatum transitioned to net consumers of N2O while bare plots remained sources as the summer progressed. Furthermore, E. vaginatum growing in the wettest parts of the study site also had significantly more extractable nitrogen in pore water collected from 75 cm below the surface, beyond the depth of most roots. We suggest the priming effect driven by the roots of this vascular plant, combined with high water levels, frees some nitrogen from previously-inaccessible recalcitrant organic matter that then is taken up by plant roots and/or soil microorganisms, preventing its release as N2O. Vascular plants may play important roles in both greenhouse gas processes and in the nutrient cycles of restored peatlands and these complex processes need further investigation to guide effective restoration efforts that aim to return these disturbed ecosystems to net greenhouse gas sinks.

Many peatland ecosystems in Europe have become degraded in the last century owing to the effects of drainage, burning, pollution and climate change. There is a need to understand the drivers of peatland degradation because management and restoration interventions are expensive and can affect the natural ecohydrological dynamics of such sensitive environments. However, if given enough time, peatlands may have the ability to recover spontaneously without deliberate action. 2. We use a detailed multiproxy palaeoecological data set from a degraded raised bog in Northern England to examine its ecosystem stability and long-term dynamics in response to anthropogenic disturbance over a variety of timescales. One feature of many degraded peatlands (including our study site) is the local dominance of Molinia caerulea (purple moor-grass), which has expanded at the expense of characteristic peatland plants, including sedges and Sphagnum mosses. 3. Our data show that there has been a long history of human impacts at the site which have culminated in its current unfavourable condition. Several distinct episodes of past peat cutting are evident as hiatuses in peat accumulation; however, peat accumulation and plant community structure have subsequently recovered spontaneously. The appearance of M. caerulea occurs coevally with an unprecedented variety of recent anthropogenic impacts, all of which have contributed to providing a suitable environment for its rise to dominance. We have dated the appearance of M. caerulea to the latter half of the twentieth century which corresponds to a number of anthropogenic press disturbances, including the following: dust loading from post-war expansion of the adjacent quarry; burning; drainage; airborne pollution; and contamination from soil dust and agrochemicals. 4. [Synthesis] Our study demonstrates the importance of palaeoecology for understanding the trajectories of peatland development and ecosystem dynamics, including their resilience and resistance to pulse and press disturbances. We show that peatlands have the capability to recover spontaneously from severe disturbances such as peat cutting, albeit on timescales much longer than those applied to contemporary monitoring of restoration efforts. The implications are relevant for determining whether it is preferable to manage and restore peatlands, or to allow them to recover naturally without human intervention.","2016-05","2025-09-04 14:55:38","2025-11-10 19:42:42","","621-636","","3","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000379014900002","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>-This paper uses a paleoecological approach to demonstrate how bog ecosystems in the UK are resilient to multiple disturbances, and argues that passive restoration is successful over the long term to restore these peatland ecosystems. </p> </div>","","","fire; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; mining; vascular plants; bog; drawdown; pollution; air pollution; fugitive dust; passive restoration; mitigation hierarchy; peat/sediment cores; graminoids; fertility change/contamination; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their value is now increasingly recognised, and restoration and rehabilitation programmes are underway to improve some of the ecosystem services provided by peatlands: blocking drainage ditches in deep peat has been shown to improve the storage of water, decrease carbon losses in the long-term, and improve biodiversity. However, whilst the restoration process has benefitted from experience and technical advice gained from restoration of deep peatlands, shallow peatlands have received less attention in the literature, despite being extensive in both uplands and lowlands. Using the experience gained from the restoration of the shallow peatlands of Exmoor National Park (UK), and two test catchments in particular, this paper provides technical guidance which can be applied to the restoration of other shallow peatlands worldwide. Experience showed that integrating knowledge of the historical environment at the planning stage of restoration was essential, as it enabled the effective mitigation of any threat to archaeological features and sites. The use of bales, commonly employed in other upland ecosystems, was found to be problematic. Instead, 'leaky dams' or wood and peat combination dams were used, which are both more efficient at reducing and diverting flow, and longer lasting than bale dams. Finally, an average restoration cost ((sic)306 ha(-1)) for Exmoor, below the median national value across the whole of the UK, demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of these techniques. However, local differences in peat depth and ditch characteristics (i.e. length, depth and width) between sites affect both the feasibility and the cost of restoration. Overall, the restoration of shallow peatlands is shown to be technically viable; this paper provides a template for such process over analogous landscapes. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This drainage has been in response to agricultural demand, forestry, horticultural and energy properties of peat and alleviation of flood risk. However, there are several environmental problems associated with drainage of peatlands. This paper describes the nature of these problems and examines the evidence for changes in hydrological and hydrochemical processes associated with these changes. Traditional black-box water balance approaches demonstrate little about wetland dynamics and therefore the science of catchment response to peat drainage is poorly understood. It is crucial that a more process-based approach be adopted within peatland ecosystems. The environmental problems associated with peat drainage have led, in part, to a recent reversal in attitudes to peatlands and we have seen a move towards wetland restoration. However, a detailed understanding of hydrological, hydrochemical and ecological process-inter-actions will be fundamental if we are to adequately restore degraded peatlands, preserve those that are still intact and understand the impacts of such management actions at the catchment scale.","2004-03-01","2025-09-05 13:58:51","2025-09-26 20:45:56","2025-09-05","95-123","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This article reviews the effects of drainage on the hydrology and biogeochemistry of peatlands.</p> <p></p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; hydrology; peatland; on-site restoration; water table; drawdown; forest harvest; mitigation hierarchy; agriculture; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rewetting aids in restoring carbon storage and sustaining unique biodiversity. However, rewetting for nature restoration is socio-economically not always feasible. Cultivation of Sphagnum biomass after rewetting allows agricultural production. In the short term, Sphagnum paludiculture is productive without fertilization but it remains unclear whether it sustains its functionality in the longer-term. We studied nutrient dynamics, organic matter build-up, and carbon and nutrient accumulation at a 16-ha Sphagnum paludiculture area in NW-Germany. Site preparation included topsoil removal and inoculation with Sphagnum and it was rewetted five and ten years ago and managed with mowing, irrigation, and ditch cleaning. The unfertilized sites were irrigated with (compared to bog conditions) nutrient-rich surface water and exposed to atmospheric nitrogen deposition of 21 kg N/ha/yr. Our data reveal that ten years of Sphagnum growth resulted in a new 30 cm thick organic layer, sequestering 2,600 kg carbon, 56 kg nitrogen, 3.2 kg phosphorus, and 9.0 kg potassium per ha/yr. Porewater nutrient concentrations were low and remained stable over time in the top layer, while ammonium concentrations decreased from 400–700 to 0–50 µmol/L in the peat profile over 10 years. Hydro-climatic fluctuations most likely caused the variation in ammonium in the top layer. We conclude that Sphagnum paludiculture enables rapid carbon and nutrient accumulation without active fertilization provided the biomass is not harvested, and provides perspective for bog restoration on agricultural peatlands. Large-scale application of Sphagnum paludiculture may mitigate environmental issues of unsustainable peatland-use.","2024-04-01","2025-09-08 13:19:43","2025-11-10 20:05:38","","347-361","","4","167","","Biogeochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that paludiculture of Sphagnum in highly managed peatlands effectively restores carbon and nutrient retention and accumulation.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; on-site restoration; vegetation; nutrients; carbon sequestration; drawdown; rewetting; bryophytes; sphagnum; agriculture; ditching; hydrological management; hydrological alteration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the topsoil is carbon-dense and preservation in situ would be favorable from a climate-mitigation perspective. The effect of reduced TSR on Sphagnum establishment and nutrient dynamics on degraded and rewetted raised bogs remains to be elucidated. We conducted a two-year field experiment under Sphagnum paludiculture management with three TSR depths: no-removal (TSR0), 5–10 cm (TSR5), and 30 cm (TSR30) removal. We tested the effects of TSR on Sphagnum establishment and performance, nutrient dynamics, and hotspot methane emissions. After two years, TSR5 produced similar Sphagnum biomass as TSR30, while vascular plant biomass was highest in TSR0. All capitula nitrogen (N > 12 mg/g) indicated N-saturation. Phosphorus (P) was not limiting (N/P < 30), but a potential potassium (K) limitation was observed in year one (N/K > 3). In TSR0, ammonium concentrations were > 150 µmol/l in year one, but decreased by 80% in year two. P-concentrations remained high (c. 100 µmol/l) at TSR0 and TSR5, and remained low at TSR30. TSR30 and TSR5 reduced hotspot methane emissions relative to TSR0. We conclude that all TSR practices have their own advantages and disadvantages with respect to Sphagnum growth, nutrient availability and vegetation development. While TSR5 may be the most suitable for paludiculture, its applicability for restoration purposes remains to be elucidated.

Sphagnum fibers are greatly desired by international markets, resulting in an increase in their extraction, thus causing environmental deterioration through overexploitation, especially in Patagonian peatlands. Given this environmental problem, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the application of two fertilizers (NH4NO3 and NaH2PO4) on the regeneration and growth rate of Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum falcatulum. An ex situ experiment was carried out in micro- and mesocosms extracted from three localities in Isla Grande de Chiloé, Los Lagos Region, Chile. The results reported that fertilization affects the development of Sphagnum moss, showing positive results on growth in height, while having a very limited effect on regeneration. Our data show a positive impact of some concentrations under natural climatic conditions. After three months, mesocosms with 10 g/m2 of NH4NO3 (3.5 g N/m2) for S. falcatulum, and 5 g/m2 of NaH2PO4 (1.3 g P/m2) for S. magellanicum, demonstrated statistically significant differences with respect to the control, with a mean growth of 15.2 mm and 5.6 mm respectively. According to the data, we can show that these treatments may be considered for the propagation of moss ex situ followed by reintroduction into the field. Field experiments are required to better understand the dynamics of nitrogen in Patagonian peatlands; nevertheless, these data suggest that attention be paid to nonpoint pollution of surface waters with nitrogen, because excessive inputs may have important effects on the growth of this natural resource.","2019-06-01","2025-09-08 13:21:26","2025-11-04 19:17:56","","257-266","","2","27","","Wetlands Ecology and Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This lab and mesocosm study examines the need for N and P fertilization for the regeneration of Sphagnum in Patagonia.</p> </div>","","","biogeochemistry; on-site restoration; nutrients; bryophytes; sphagnum; vegetation disturbance; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Alberta Wetland Rapid Evaluation Tool-Actual (ABWRET-A) was developed to quantify wetland functions in support of policy implementation. We evaluated > 200 wetlands used to calibrate ABWRET-A and > 2000 wetlands targeted for loss under the policy to understand potential biases in the system. We compared the functional value of wetlands targeted for loss to the pool of wetlands used to calibrate ABWRET-A and to the general population of wetlands in Alberta's settled region. We evaluated ABWRET-A calibration and scoring and found that wetlands used in tool calibration were over 8 times larger (median size = 2.07 ha, n = 207 vs. 0.245 ha, n = 1,782,001), more permanently ponded and distributed approximately 2.5 times closer to roads (median distance = 162.1 m, n = 207 vs. 399.7 m, n = 1,782,001) than the general wetland population. Calibration wetlands also underrepresented bogs and overrepresented fens. This influenced scores, as larger wetlands and wetlands classified as fens receive higher ABWRET-A scores, whereas wetlands close to roads received lower scores. We conclude that scores may underestimate functional value. Wetlands targeted for permitted loss were larger (median size = 0.290 ha, n = 2087) and more road-proximate (median distance = 237.0 m, n = 2087) than the average wetland from the inventory. Crucially, permitted wetland loss is significantly clustered around major cities (using Getis-Ord Gi statistic; p < 0.01), implying permanent loss of wetland functions in peri-urban areas.","2022-10","2025-09-09 20:48:00","2025-11-10 19:22:29","2022-08-12","575-587","","","136","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000835159800013","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper tests the biases of the Alberta rapid wetland assessment tool.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; vegetation; other wetland; bog; monitoring; roads; fen; ecosystem services; marsh; cities/towns/villages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objectives were to (a) develop methods to identify conifer trees vs. deciduous shrubs and trees using multi-spectral lidar data, (b) quantify the proportional coverage of shrubs and trees to determine environmental conditions driving shrub regeneration, and (c) determine the spatial variations in shrub and tree heights as an indicator of cumulative growth since the fire. The results show that the use of lidar-derived structural metrics predicted areas of deciduous shrub establishment (92% accuracy) and classification of deciduous and conifer trees (71% accuracy). Burned bogs and fens were more prone to shrub regeneration up to and including 38 years after the fire. The transition from deciduous to conifer trees occurred approximately 30 years post-fire.

This paper describes the ecological characteristics and importance of PPR wetlands and the use of remote sensing for mapping and monitoring applications. While there are comprehensive reviews for wetland remote sensing in recent publications, there is no comprehensive review about the use of remote sensing in the PPR. First, the PPR is described, including the wetland classification systems that have been used, the water regimes that control the surface water and water levels, and the soil and vegetation characteristics of the region. The tools and techniques that have been used in the PPR for analyses of geospatial data for wetland applications are described. Field observations for ground truth data are critical for good validation and accuracy assessment of the many products that are produced. Wetland classification approaches are reviewed, including Decision Trees, Machine Learning, and object versus pixel-based approaches. A comprehensive description of the remote sensing systems and data that have been employed by various studies in the PPR is provided. A wide range of data can be used for various applications, including passive optical data like aerial photographs or satellite-based, Earth-observation data. Both airborne and spaceborne lidar studies are described. A detailed description of Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data and research are provided. The state of the art is the use of multi-source data to achieve higher accuracies and hybrid approaches. Digital Surface Models are also being incorporated in geospatial analyses to separate forest and shrub and emergent systems based on vegetation height. Remote sensing provides a cost-effective mechanism for mapping and monitoring PPR wetlands, especially with the logistical difficulties and cost of field-based methods. The wetland characteristics of the PPR dictate the need for high resolution in both time and space, which is increasingly possible with the numerous and increasing remote sensing systems available and the trend to open-source data and tools. The fusion of multi-source remote sensing data via state-of-the-art machine learning is recommended for wetland applications in the PPR. The use of such data promotes flexibility for sensor addition, subtraction, or substitution as a function of application needs and potential cost restrictions. This is important in the PPR because of the challenges related to the highly dynamic nature of this unique region.","2021-10","2025-09-09 20:48:00","2025-11-04 20:35:32","2021-10-27","","","19","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000707842900001","","","Alberta Environm & Pk Ducks Unlimited Canada","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper examines the potential for remote sensing using multiple methods to monitor the extent and surface water in marsh and shallow open water wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America.

Here we describe: (a) current technologies used for wetland assessment and monitoring; (b) the latest algorithmic developments for wetland assessment; (c) new technologies; and (d) a framework for wetland sampling in support of remotely sensed data collection. Results illustrate that high or fine spatial resolution pixels (<= 10 m) are critical for identifying wetland boundaries and extent, and wetland class, form and type, but are not required for all wetland sizes. Average accuracies can be up to 11% better (on average) than medium resolution (11-30 m) data pixels when compared with field validation. Wetland size is also a critical factor such that large wetlands may be almost as accurately classified using medium-resolution data (average = 76% accuracy, stdev = 21%).

We also quantified and compared the logistics required to implement each protocol. The macroinvertebrate communities differed statistically between protocols for all three response variables; however, the differences were generally small and communities similar. The CTA protocol tended to yield higher variability in the samples, likely driven by the way these samples are collected and composited, which may introduce an unwanted source of variation when the primary monitoring objective is to assess effects of human activities over time and between sites. The CTA protocol also required significantly greater investment of time (ca. 50% greater processing time), money (ca. 1.9 times sample processing cost), and resources to execute (e.g., requirement for watercraft). Both protocols provided adequate characterization of macroinvertebrate communities in wetlands, but differences in variability and resources for deployment and processing are important considerations when choosing a sampling protocol. The rapid time-limited sweep protocol (TSA) appears to be a viable monitoring approach given that macroinvertebrate communities identified by each protocol were relatively similar but were collected using the TSA protocol at a lower cost.","2020-04","2025-09-09 20:48:00","2025-09-26 20:34:39","2020-02-12","199-216","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000513047900001","","","Alberta Environm & Pk","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- &nbsp;This paper compares protocols for the monitoring of benthic macroinvertebrates in wetlands in Alberta.

Despite efforts to monitor the impacts of oil sands energy extraction-related activities on wetland ecology, few studies examine the impacts of diverse human development types on wetland plant communities. Here, we sought to quantify the effects of human development in the Athabasca, Peace River. and Cold Lake Oil Sands Regions in Alberta, Canada, and to examine its impact on wetland plant community composition. Across the region, we found that total development and development related to energy and mining were both low; similar to 80% of the study area was undeveloped. Despite the low spatial extent, total anthropogenic development was negatively correlated with site-level conservatism (a metric of plant tolerance to environmental perturbation) in all five wetland classes examined. This suggests that wetlands surrounded by human development are inhabited by generalist species that are tolerant of environmental disturbance. Moreover, distinct floristic groups within each wetland class could be distinguished based on their total developed area, providing additional evidence that human development affects plant composition and diversity, despite its limited extent in the study area. In contrast to total development, energy and mining development had an inconsistent or no detectable impact on wetland plant community composition at the regional level, likely because although oils sands surface mining is intensive, it is spatially restricted to a small area within the oil sands region. Our findings show that wetland plant communities in the oil sands region are impacted by multiple types of human land use concurrently; further research should aim to evaluate both the distinct impacts of different land use types using gradients of development intensity, as well as the cumulative impacts of multiple land use types happening concurrently.","2019-11-25","2025-09-09 20:48:00","2025-09-26 17:30:04","2019-10-22","","","","693","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000489694700068","","","Alberta Environm & Pk","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper shows how total development (but not energy development) favours more generalist species in wetlands within the Alberta Oil Sands.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; vegetation; mining; other wetland; bog; substrate disturbance; fen; agriculture; vegetation disturbance; marsh; shallow water wetland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results were compared with 31 field measurement points for six wetlands at riparian transition zones and surface water extents in the Utikuma Regional Study Area (URSA).

Concordance results comparing the semi-permanent/permanent hydroperiod between 2015 and 2016 were found to be 98% similar, suggesting little change in wetland surface water extent between these two years. The results illustrate that the decision-based methodology and data fusion could be applied to a wide range of boreal wetland types and, so far, is not geographically limited.

Increasingly. peat industries are faced with the task of restoring abandoned, harvested peatlands where the environmental conditions closely resemble a fen. The goal of this research project is to explore techniques for the restoration of fen plant communities on vacuum-extracted peatlands in Canada. The plant succession on abandoned, harvested peatlands where peat has been extracted to the minerotrophic layers was examined to détermine which plants frequently colonize thèse abandoned sites. After surveying 28 abandoned harvested fens across Canada and in Minnesota. USA. the spontaneous végétation was not similar to the végétation found on undisturbed fens from the same areas. Specifîcally, Sphagnum and Carex species, abundant on undisturbed fens were not found on abandoned. vacuum-harvested fens. However, harvested fens were quickly recolonized by marsh species if they were not actively drained. A field experiment was carried out to test two reintroduction techniques for Sphagnum and Carex species as well as the use of phosphate fertilizer. The application of donor diaspores, commonly used for dry peatland restoration was effective for reintroducing both Carex and Sphagnum species. In the past, the focus of fen restoration has been vascular plants. In order to find out more about the environmental conditions necessary for the végétative régénération of eight common fen mosses, field and greenhouse experiments were carried out. The présence of shade was shown to greatly improve the régénération of the mosses. The optimal water level for most species was just under the surface and Sphagnum species were shown to be the most successful at regenerating. The findings of this research will aid the development of stratégies for the restoration of fens on harvested peatlands.","2008","2025-09-09 21:36:21","2025-10-02 14:01:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université Laval","Québec","","","PhD","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- &nbsp;This thesis presents several studies on the restoration of post-extracted fen peatlands in North America.</p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; bryophytes; sphagnum; active restoration; fen; mitigation hierarchy; graminoids; brown mosses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results: Sphagnum transfer, a reintroduction technique commonly used for bog restoration in North America, was effective for establishing Sphagnum and Carex species. The hay transfer method, commonly used for fen restoration in Europe, was much less successful, probably due to questionable viability of reintroduced seeds. The treatments which included light phosphorus fertilization, had a higher Carex cover after three growing seasons. The timing of the reintroductions had no impact on the success of vegetation establishment. However, vegetation reintroduction should be carried out in the spring while the ground is still frozen to minimize other ecological impacts.

However, some plants have the ability to colonize dry peat deposits, and seem to help stabilize the soil surface and facilitate the establishment of other plant species. In this paper, we review studies regarding the spontaneous regeneration of ombrotrophic peatlands. There are numerous examples throughout North America and Europe showing that spontaneous revegetation of mined peatlands by typical bog plants, and particularly by Sphagnum species, is possible. However, this phenomenon is much more common in block-cut peatlands than in vacuum-mined sites. The slow recovery of vacuum-mined peatlands compared to block-cut sites is probably related to intense drainage necessary for the use of tractor-drawn vacuum machines. There are some cases, however, where the spontaneous revegetation of vacuum-mined sites is successful, particularly for vascular plants. These sites aremainly dominated by cotton-grass (Eriophorum vaginatum L.). It seems that the microclimatic conditions created by cotton-grass tussocks improve establishment conditions for other vascular and non-vascular plants. Restoration activities should be minimal in mined peatlands already invaded by cotton-grass, and spontaneous revegetation processes could and should be integrated into peatland restoration programs.","2003-02","2025-09-10 18:04:20","2025-11-04 19:04:05","2003-02-01","97-107","","1-2","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000411977700008","","","LINeco","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper reviews the processes of natural revegetation of post-extraction peatlands in eastern Canada, including block-cut and vacuum extraction peatlands, and argues for the role of natural regeneration processes as an approach for restoration. </p> </div>","","","Canada; peatland; on-site restoration; vegetation; vascular plants; substrate disturbance; drawdown; bryophytes; sphagnum; passive restoration; vegetation disturbance; graminoids; hydrological alteration; peat/moss extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The synthesis is unique in its broad scope (global evidence for a comprehensive list of 125 interventions) and practitioner-focused outputs (short narrative summaries in plain English, integrated into a searchable online database). Systematic literature searches, supplemented by recommendations from an international advisory board, identified 162 publications containing 296 distinct tests of 66 of the interventions. Most of the articles studied open bogs or fens in Europe or North America. Only 36 interventions were supported by sufficient evidence to assess their overall effectiveness. Most of these interventions (85 %) had positive effects, overall, on peatland vegetation - although this figure is likely to have been inflated by publication bias. We discuss how to use the synthesis, critically, to inform conservation decisions. Reflecting on the content of the synthesis we make suggestions for the future of peatland conservation, from monitoring over appropriate timeframes to routinely publishing results to build up the evidence base.","2019-06-21","2025-09-16 12:04:05","2025-11-10 19:50:16","2025-09-16 12:04:05","1–21","","24","","","","A synthesis of evidence for the effects of interventions to conserve peatland vegetation","","","","","","","eng","","","","","DOI.org (CSL JSON)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper takes a critical examination of 125 different interventions to restore disturbed peatlands in Europe and North America and categorizes them according to evidence of their their beneficial/neutral/harmful effects.</p> </div>","","","fire; peatland; on-site restoration; nutrients; rewetting; monitoring; bryophytes; mitigation hierarchy; hydrological management; herbivory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adaptation of the index proceeded to identify, through a literature review, the physico-chemical parameters that may change due to peat harvesting. The CCME WQI was used to compare water quality of receiving watercourses to that of streams located within a 200 km radius from the study sites in three regions of Quebec. The availability of water quality data guided the selection of parameters among those identified. They are ammonia, conductivity, pH and suspended sediment concentrations.

In rich fens, peat is formed by brown mosses and belowground biomass of vascular plants. However, the impact of ecohydrological settings on the contribution of mosses and belowground biomass to peat formation remains an open question. We established seven transects in well-preserved fens in NE Poland along an ecohydrological gradient from mesotrophic sedge-moss communities with stable water levels, to more eutrophic tall sedge communities with higher water level fluctuations. In each transect, we measured the production of brown mosses (using the plug method), aboveground vascular plant biomass (one year after cutting) and belowground biomass (using ingrowth cores). Decomposition rates of all biomass fractions were assessed using litter bags. The first-year surplus of potentially peat-forming fractions, i.e., mosses and belowground biomass, decreased with increasing water level fluctuations and along a vegetation gradient from sedge-moss to tall sedge communities. Moss production was highest in the sedge-moss fen with a stable water level at the ground surface. We did not detect any difference in belowground biomass production across the gradient but found it to be consistently higher in the upper 0–5 cm than in the deeper layers. The decomposition rate also showed no response to the gradient, but differed between biomass types, with aboveground biomass of vascular plants decomposing 2.5 times faster than belowground biomass and mosses. Pattern of peat formation potential along the ecohydrological gradient in rich fen was strongly driven by brown moss production. Sedge-moss fens with a stable water level at the ground surface have the highest peat formation capacity compared to other vegetation types. In the part of the gradient that is poorer in nutrients, vascular plants invest in belowground production, and mosses dominate the aboveground layer.","2024-10-15","2025-09-16 13:02:11","2025-10-02 18:55:53","","174617","","","947","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates how low water table fluctuations supports peat formation by brown mosses and vascular plant underground biomass in rich fens in Poland.</p> </div>","","","hydrology; peatland; vegetation; vascular plants; decomposition; peat; water table; carbon sequestration; carbon cycle; primary productivity; bryophytes; fen; substrate; brown mosses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, most land reclamation efforts have focused on recreating upland forestlands that resemble the surrounding natural (dry) boreal forest. However, the surficial conditions on these reclaimed upland sites can also promote spontaneous wetland development. At Suncor’s Base Plant mine, opportunistic wetlands occurring on reclamation sites have not been formally included in the current inventory of reclaimed wetland areas and remain largely unquantified. We characterized and delineated an estimated 210 ha of opportunistic wetlands (consisting of shallow open water, marshes, and swamps) using aerial photo interpretation and remote sensing analysis in combination with follow-up field verifications. The remote-based (desktop) delineations consistently underestimated actual wetland extents, due mainly to underestimations in the extent of non-inundated vegetation zones (e.g., wet meadow) as well as shrubby swamp. After field corrections, opportunistic wetland habitat was estimated to constitute ~ 17% of the total study area (1209 ha), representing more than a fourfold increase in aerial wetland extent associated with reclaimed landforms over that delineated prior to this study. The interspersion of opportunistic wetlands with upland reclaimed landforms, although unintended, more closely reflects the pre-disturbance landscape, which was characterized by a matrix of forestlands, peatlands, and mineral wetlands (in contrast to the more peatland-dominated lowlands). At Suncor, wetland vegetation composition varied significantly across the study area and was influenced by topographic variation (e.g., in elevation and % slope) in combination with the reclamation substrates (soils) that were placed prior to seeding/planting. Thus, the inclusion of opportunistic wetland delineation in reclamation tracking and closure planning merits consideration as does the opportunity to manipulate current reclamation practices to promote the establishment and persistence of wetlands on reclaimed landforms.","2020-12-01","2025-09-26 14:42:18","2025-09-26 20:39:13","","953-970","","6","28","","Wetlands Ecology and Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>- This paper demonstrates that wetlands are created alongside upland reclamation efforts after mine reclamation in the Alberta oil sands.</p> </div>","","","Canada; on-site restoration; mining; other wetland; remote sensing; monitoring; mine reclamation; marsh; landscape conversion/fragmentation; shallow water wetland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Potential for restoration should be considered in nondesignated sites. We reviewed a number of case studies covering a range of restoration approaches used in different parts of Western Europe. We found that published evidence of restoration progress was limited to specific sites/areas, and in many cases lacked baseline measurements and clear goals, that is, measurable target or contemporary reference(s).

The first, called the Lisse effect, occurred during rains of high intensity when the infiltrating water acted as a tightly closing lid that forced the water table to rise to the level required to compensate for the pressure increase. The second, called the Wieringermeer effect, was a rapid rise of the water table to the surface due to the conversion of capillary to phreatic water and was always followed by an equally rapid decline after cessation of the rainfall. We simulated these phenomena in the laboratory and estimated the critical parameters that determine their occurrence.

Forest-to-bog restoration aims to reverse these impacts by re-establishing peatland habitats, benefiting biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, the timescales and patterns of bird recolonization remain poorly understood, especially regarding management techniques like hydrological ground reprofiling. Objectives This study investigates bird colonization in forest-to-bog restoration areas at the Forsinard Flows RSPB Reserve. Methods We analyzed breeding bird survey data and records from 2008, 2016, and 2022 across peatland restoration areas under different management approaches. Colonization was assessed by identifying confirmed and probable breeding records in relation to the time since restoration interventions (felling and reprofiling). Results Thirteen peatland specialist species?including four Red-listed Birds of Conservation Concern?were recorded breeding in restoration areas, alongside 10 non-peatland species, including three Red-listed species. Meadow pipit and Skylark colonized rapidly, often within the first year post-felling. Sensitive waders such as Dunlin and Golden plover were recorded breeding within 8?years, and earlier in reprofiled areas. Woodland-associated species declined, particularly after reprofiling. However, densities of key waders remain lower in restored areas than in intact bogs, likely due to residual forestry, incomplete reprofiling, and gradual habitat recovery. Conclusions Forest-to-bog restoration supports recolonization by peatland specialist birds, with reprofiling accelerating the return of key species.","2025-09-01","2025-11-10 22:22:51","2025-11-10 22:26:03","2025-11-10","e70129","","7","33","","Restoration Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","biodiversity conservation; bird recovery; passerines; peatland restoration; waders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The predictions assume stable plant communities but how realistic is this assumption? If the vegetation is not stable, what are the nature and rate of changes? Location Peatland complex in Southern Finland. Methods We conducted a water level drawdown (WLD of ~10 cm) experiment over 17 years in three peatland types differing in their fertility. On each peatland type, we included an adjacent forestry drained (FD, with water table ca. 40 cm lower than in control) area for comparison. Results Peatland type had a clear impact on the response to WLD: at the ecosystem level, the two minerotrophic fens underwent rapid species turnover, while the vegetation in nutrient-poor bog was more resilient to change. In nutrient-rich sites, WLD initiated tree canopy development and created understorey conditions that strengthened impact of WLD. In nutrient-poor site, tree establishment was seen only in the FD area. In addition to high nutrient level, high wetness accelerated change at the plant community level, where we found three types of responses: accelerating change, decelerating change, and stability. Succession resulted in an overall loss of community heterogeneity. Conclusions Interaction between hydrology, nutrient availability, and biological factors in boreal peatlands is important: the drop in water table required to achieve the shift from open peatland to forested system is inversely proportional to the nutrient level of the system. The results suggest that predictive models of peatland functions under climate change should consider compositional change for fens and their diverse plant communities but are more realistic for bogs. The response of bog vegetation to climate change may, however, be more dependent on changes in rainfall regime and therefore needs to be further addressed.","2019-11-01","2025-11-10 22:22:53","2025-11-10 22:22:53","2025-11-10","1206-1216","","6","30","","Journal of Vegetation Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","peatland; vegetation; bog; fen; canopy development; global environmental change; succession; water level change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Restoration via re-wetting could play an important role in climate change mitigation, reducing CO2 emissions and increasing C storage within peatlands. However, re-wetting leads to a biogeochemical compromise between increased CO2 uptake, and enhanced methane (CH4) release. The extent of this compromise in re-wetted ecosystems with differing environmental conditions is uncertain. To assess re-wetting effects, we analyzed eddy-covariance flux measurements from a temperate bog near Vancouver, Canada, from two sites that have undergone different restoration techniques. By the end of the 1-year study period, the actively re-wetted, wetter site, was a weak CO2 sink (?26.1 ± 6.1 g C-CO2 m?2), and the passively re-wetted, drier site, was near CO2 neutral (3.8 ± 3.1 g C-CO2 m?2). Higher CH4 emissions at the wetter site led to a larger radiative balance on 20- and 100-year time horizons, implying that the strong radiative effect of CH4 can offset CO2 sink strength on shorter to medium timeframes. However, long-term radiative forcing (RF) modeling suggests sustained CO2 uptake by the wetter site will eventually lead to a cooling effect on the climate. Furthermore, modeling results emphasize that despite both re-wetted peatland sites having a positive RF over century timescales, the lack of restoration would have resulted in a significantly larger RF beyond the first few decades following restoration. Results highlight the importance of actively re-wetting disturbed peatlands to mitigate climate warming and can be used to inform management decisions.","2022-09-01","2025-11-10 22:24:09","2025-11-10 22:26:09","2025-11-10","e2022JG006881","","9","127","","Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","peatland; rewetting; carbon; eddy covariance; greenhouse gas; methane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is still much uncertainty about how the GHG dynamics of peatlands are affected by climate and land use change. Current field-based methods of estimating annual carbon exchange between peatlands and the atmosphere include flux chambers and eddy covariance towers. However, remote sensing has several advantages over these traditional approaches in terms of cost, spatial coverage and accessibility to remote locations. In this paper, we outline the basic principles of using remote sensing to estimate ecosystem carbon fluxes and explain the range of satellite data available for such estimations, considering the indices and models developed to make use of the data. Past studies, which have used remote sensing data in comparison with ground-based calculations of carbon fluxes over Northern peatland landscapes, are discussed, as well as the challenges of working with remote sensing on peatlands. Finally, we suggest areas in need of future work on this topic. We conclude that the application of remote sensing to models of carbon fluxes is a viable research method over Northern peatlands but further work is needed to develop more comprehensive carbon cycle models and to improve the long-term reliability of models, particularly on peatland sites undergoing restoration.","2018-02-15","2025-11-18 19:05:25","2025-11-18 20:16:00","","857-874","","","615","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GPP; NEE; Respiration; Restored peatlands; Satellites; Vegetation indices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treed peatlands have previously received little attention with regard to wildfire management; however, their role in fire spread, and the contribution of peat smouldering to dangerous air pollution, have recently been highlighted. To help develop effective wildfire management techniques in treed peatlands, we use seismic line disturbance as an analog for peatland fuel modification treatments. To delineate below-ground hydrocarbon resources using seismic waves, seismic lines are created by removing above-ground (canopy) fuels using heavy machinery, forming linear disturbances through some treed peatlands. We found significant differences in moisture content and peat bulk density with depth between seismic line and undisturbed plots, where smouldering combustion potential was lower in seismic lines. Sphagnum mosses dominated seismic lines and canopy fuel load was reduced for up to 55 years compared to undisturbed peatlands. Sphagnum mosses had significantly lower smouldering potential than feather mosses (that dominate mature, undisturbed peatlands) in a laboratory drying experiment, suggesting that fuel modification treatments following a strategy based on seismic line analogs would be effective at reducing smouldering potential at the WSI, especially under increasing fire weather.","2020","2025-11-18 19:10:24","2025-11-18 19:10:24","","","","2","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","smouldering; combustion; moisture retention; organic soil; peat properties; wildfire management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, for the first time, we combine existing knowledge of the controls on smouldering peat fire with expert opinion-based weightings through a multi-criteria decision analysis, to map the smouldering fire potential (i.e. hazard) of treed peatlands in the Boreal Plains, Alberta, Canada. We find that smouldering potential varies considerably between treed peatlands and that areas of sparser peatland coverage may contain high smouldering-potential peatlands. Further, we find that treed peatlands are a common feature in the wildland–human interface and that proportionally, the area of high smouldering potential is greater closer to roads compared with farther away. Our approach enables a quantitative measure of smouldering fire potential and evidences the need to incorporate peatland–wildfire interactions into wildfire management operations. We suggest that similar frameworks could be used in other peatland dominated regions as part of smouldering fire risk assessments.","2021-05-18","2025-11-18 19:10:35","2025-11-18 19:10:35","2025-11-18","552-563","","7","30","","International Journal of Wildland Fire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This, in turn, shapes the distribution of bryophyte communities. Disturbances can lead to a loss of this microtopographic variation, impacting the bryophyte community. Seismic lines are deforested linear disturbances (approximately 3?8 m wide) created during oil and gas exploration and very extensive in Alberta, Canada. Loss of microtopographic variation leads to slow tree recovery on seismic lines in treed peatlands. To facilitate tree establishment, mounding is being applied to restore the microtopography on seismic lines. We compared bryophyte communities on unmounded and mounded seismic lines (18?years after seismic line creation, 3?years after mounding), and in adjacent treed fens as the reference, to evaluate how recovery varies with microtopographic position (i.e., top of hummock, slope or side of the hummock, and level ground). We found that recovery on the unmounded seismic lines was underway 18?years after seismic lines were created, while mounding redisturbed the sites and thus set back recovery, at least in the short term (3?years post-mounding). In unmounded seismic lines, Sphagnum cover was similar to that of reference treatments at all microtopographic positions. In contrast, mounded seismic lines had lower Sphagnum cover and higher cover of true mosses (sans feather mosses) than reference and unmounded treatments. Overall, these results show mounding sets back the recovery of bryophyte communities?the very organisms responsible for the microtopographic variation we are trying to establish. Further monitoring is needed to understand how this changes over time.","2023-03-01","2025-11-18 19:15:17","2025-11-18 19:15:17","2025-11-18","e13813","","3","31","","Restoration Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","seismic lines; microtopography; ground layer; moderate-rich fens; Sphagnum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined how road and environmental conditions influence woody cover in treed fens in northeastern Alberta, Canada. We used generalized linear mixed models to explain variation in cover as measured using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data obtained for 48 road-bisected fens. Over half of the study fens had >10% differences in canopy cover between the upstream and downstream sides. Variation in cover was best explained by a complex interaction between road side, distance, and type, as well as distance to upland forest and open water, in both rich and poor treed fens. Substrate texture (fine vs. coarse) further explained cover in rich fens. Gravel roads appeared to have the most dramatic effect on cover adjacent to roads (0?20?m) in both fen types, with differences persisting beyond 100?m. In fens bisected by gravel and paved roads, differences in cover between road sides tended to be ameliorated within 200?m, except for unimproved roads where changes were more linear. This study demonstrates the complexity of landscape conditions under which roads built through peatlands can cause structural changes in woody cover and the usefulness of ALS data for studying this phenomenon.","2022-10-01","2025-11-18 19:17:20","2025-11-18 19:17:20","2025-11-18","e2455","","7","15","","Ecohydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","airborne laser scanning; boreal peatland; flooding and drying; resource access roads; road construction; woody plant cover","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cell damage in response to high temperature exposure in the laboratory was also quantified for five different Sphagnum species (S. capillifolium, S. papillosum, S. magellanicum, S. austinii and S. angustifolium). Maximum temperatures recorded at the moss surface during fire ranged from 33 °C to 538 °C and were higher in plots with greater dwarf shrub cover. Higher temperatures were associated with a greater proportion of cell damage in S. capillifolium, with 93–100% cell damage observed 10 weeks after burning in the upper parts of plants exposed to temperatures over 400 °C. All five species tested in the laboratory experiment also showed more damage at higher temperatures, with damage occurring immediately after heat exposure.

Here, we examine the impact of warming and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) on the molecular composition of SOC to infer SOC sources (microbe-, plant- and fire-derived) and stability in a boreal peatland. We show that while warming alone decreased plant- and microbe-derived SOC due to enhanced decomposition, warming combined with eCO2 increased plant-derived SOC compounds. We further observed increasing root-derived inputs (suberin) and declining leaf/needle-derived inputs (cutin) into SOC under warming and eCO2. The decline in SOC compounds with warming and gains from new root-derived C under eCO2, suggest that warming and eCO2 may shift peatland C budget towards pools with faster turnover.

Their persistence, despite potential evapotranspiration (PET) often exceeding annual precipitation, is attributed to various water storage mechanisms. One storage element that has been understudied is seasonal ground ice (SGI). This study characterized spring SGI conditions and explored its impacts on available energy, actual evapotranspiration, water table, and near surface soil moisture in a western boreal plains peatland. The majority of SGI melt took place over May 2017. Microtopography had limited impact on melt rates due to wet conditions. SGI melt released 139mm in ice water equivalent (IWE) within the top 30cm of the peat, and weak significant relationships with water table and surface moisture suggest that SGI could be important for maintaining vegetation transpiration during dry springs. Melting SGI decreased available energy causing small reductions in PET (<10mm over the melt period) and appeared to reduce actual evapotranspiration variability but not mean rates, likely due to slow melt rates. This suggests that melting SGI supplies water, allowing evapotranspiration to occur at near potential rates, but reduces the overall rate at which evapotranspiration could occur (PET). The role of SGI may help peatlands in headwater catchments act as a conveyor of water to downstream landscapes during the spring while acting as a supply of water for the peatland. Future work should investigate SGI influences on evapotranspiration under differing peatland types, wet and dry spring conditions, and if the spatial variability of SGI melt leads to spatial variability in evapotranspiration.","2020-01-30","2025-11-18 19:28:19","2025-11-18 19:28:19","2025-11-18","765-779","","3","34","","Hydrological Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","evapotranspiration; microtopography; ground heat flux; peatlands; seasonal ground ice; western boreal plain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study analyses the most common restoration pathways employed in boreal and temperate peatlands, potentially applicable in tropical peat swamp forests. Our analysis focuses on the GHG emissions and C retention potential of the restoration measures. To assess the C stock change in restored (rewetted) peatlands and afforested peatlands with continuous drainage, we adopt a conceptual approach that considers short-term C capture (GHG exchange between the atmosphere and the peatland ecosystem) and long-term C sequestration in peat. The primary criterion of our conceptual model is the capacity of restoration measures to capture C and reduce GHG emissions. Our findings indicate that carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most influential part of long-term climate impact of restored peatlands, whereas moderate methane (CH4) emissions and low N2O fluxes are relatively unimportant. However, lateral losses of dissolved and particulate C in water can account up to a half of the total C stock change. Among the restored peatland types, Sphagnum paludiculture showed the highest CO2 capture, followed by shallow lakes and reed/grass paludiculture. Shallow lakeshore vegetation in restored peatlands can reduce CO2 emissions and sequester C but still emit CH4, particularly during the first 20 years after restoration. Our conceptual modelling approach reveals that over a 300-year period, under stable climate conditions, drained bog forests can lose up to 50% of initial C content. In managed (regularly harvested) and continuously drained peatland forests, C accumulation in biomass and litter input does not compensate C losses from peat. In contrast, rewetted unmanaged peatland forests are turning into a persistent C sink. The modelling results emphasized the importance of long-term C balance analysis which considers soil C accumulation, moving beyond the short-term C cycling between vegetation and the atmosphere.","2024-04-01","2025-11-18 19:29:04","2025-11-18 19:29:04","","523-543","","4","167","","Biogeochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While over 98% of Canadian peatlands are intact, agriculture has been estimated as accounting for the greatest peatland disturbance by area. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from peatland agriculture can contribute a large proportion of national anthropogenic emissions for some countries. In Canada, estimates of GHG emissions from cultivated peat soils are incomplete. Improved accounting of these GHG emissions is required to inform decisions about where to deploy ecological restoration projects and where to allow future agricultural expansion as climate warms. Compiled studies that measured GHG fluxes from agricultural peat fields in Canada resulted in mean emissions factors of 5.1?t CO2e ha?1?year?1, ?0.12?kg CH4 ha?1?year?1, and 14.3?kg N2O-N?ha?1?year?1 for carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, respectively. Combining these values with a compilation of estimates of agricultural peatland disturbance area in Canada, GHG emissions estimates in Canada arising from peatland converted to agriculture remain highly uncertain, ranging from 1.4 to 35 Mt CO2e year?1, with a median value near 18 Mt CO2e year?1. The largest contributor to this wide range of estimates is uncertainty peatland area affected, indicating an urgent need to improving mapping of organic soils under agriculture in Canada. To help guide decision-making in Canada, we recommend a network of research stations across a range of agricultural management intensities and climate regions for monitoring hydrological conditions and GHG exchange on organic soils affected by agriculture.","2025-01-01","2025-11-18 19:31:35","2025-11-18 19:31:35","2025-11-18","e925","","1","16","","WIREs Climate Change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","methane; carbon dioxide; land-use change; nitrous oxide; organic soils","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peatland types and sub-classes vary in their ecohydrological characteristics and are expected to have different responses to climate change. Large-scale modelling frameworks such as the Canadian Model for Peatlands, the Canadian Fire Behaviour Prediction System and the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System require peatland maps including information on sub-types and vegetation as critical inputs. Additionally, peatland class and vegetation height are critical variables for wildlife habitat management and are related to the carbon cycle and wildfire fuel loading. This research aimed to create a map of peatland sub-classes (bog, poor fen, rich fen permafrost peat complex) for the Canadian boreal forest and create an inventory of peatland vegetation height characteristics using ICESat-2. A three-stage hierarchical classification framework was developed to map peatland sub-classes within the Canadian boreal forest circa 2020. Training and validation data consisted of peatland locations derived from various sources (field data, aerial photo interpretation, measurements documented in literature). A combination of multispectral data, L-band SAR backscatter and C-Band interferometric SAR coherence, forest structure and ancillary variables was used as model predictors. Ancillary data were used to mask agricultural areas and urban regions and account for regions that may exhibit permafrost. In the first stage of the classification, wetlands, uplands and water were classified with 86.5% accuracy. In the second stage, within the wetland areas only, peatland and mineral wetlands were differentiated with 93.3% accuracy. In the third stage, constrained to only the peatland areas, bogs, rich fens, poor fens and permafrost peat complexes were classified with 71.5% accuracy. Then, ICESat-2 ATL08 spaceborne lidar data were used to describe regional variations in peatland vegetation height characteristics and regional and class-wise variations based on a boreal forest wide sample. This research introduced a comprehensive large-scale peatland sub-class mapping framework for the Canadian boreal forest, presenting the first moderate resolution map of its kind.","2024-08-01","2025-11-18 19:32:30","2025-11-18 21:04:14","2025-11-18","500-516","","4","10","","Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","peatland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied Pine Fen Creek catchment in the Boreal Plains ecozone of central Saskatchewan, Canada, which has a large, valley-bottom, terminally positioned peatland, two lakes, and forested uplands. A shorter intensive study permitted a more detailed partitioning of water inputs and outputs within the catchment during the low flow period, and an assessment of a 10-year data set provided insight into the function of the peatland over a range of climate conditions. Using a water balance approach, we learned that two key processes regulate flow of Pine Fen Creek. The cumulative impact of landscape unit hydrological connectivity and the peatland's hydrological functional state were needed to understand catchment response. There was evidence of a run-off threshold which, when crossed, changed the peatland's hydrological function from transmission to run-off generation. Results also suggest the peatland should behave more often as a transmitter of groundwater than as a generator of run-off under a drier climate future, owing to a reduced water supply.","2019-02-15","2025-11-18 19:33:21","2025-11-18 19:33:21","2025-11-18","562-574","","4","33","","Hydrological Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","climate change; peatland; Boreal Plains; glacial landforms; groundwater flow; hydrological connectivity; hydrological function","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microtopography integrates these factors into features called microforms. Microforms often differ in CH4 emissions, but microform-dependent patterns of belowground CH4 cycling remain less clearly resolved. To investigate the impact of microtopography on belowground CH4 cycling, we characterized depth profiles of the community composition and activity of CH4-cycling microbes using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, incubations, and measurements of porewater CH4 concentration and isotopic composition from hummocks and lawns at Sallie's Fen in NH, USA. Geochemical proxies of methanogenesis and methanotrophy indicated that microforms differ in dominant microbial CH4 cycling processes. Hummocks, where water table depth is lower, had higher porewater redox potential (Eh) and higher porewater δ13C-CH4 values in the upper 30 cm than lawns, where water table depth is closer to the peat surface. Porewater δ13C-CH4 and δD-CH3D values were highest at the surface of hummocks where the ratio of methanotrophs to methanogens was also greatest. These results suggest that belowground CH4 cycling in hummocks is more strongly regulated by methanotrophy, while in lawns methanogenesis is more dominant. We also investigated controls of porewater CH4 chemistry. The ratio of the relative abundance of methanotrophs to methanogens was the strongest predictor of porewater CH4 concentration and δ13C-CH4, while vegetation composition had minimal influence. As microbial community composition was strongly influenced by redox conditions but not vegetation, we conclude that water table depth is a stronger control of belowground CH4 cycling across microforms than vegetation.","2022-08-01","2025-11-18 19:39:05","2025-11-18 19:39:05","2025-11-18","e2022JG006948","","8","127","","Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","microtopography; methane; peatlands; methanogenesis; methanotrophy; stable isotopes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there have been only a few studies in which post-restoration hydrological changes have been quantified with RS-based modelling. To address this gap, we developed an approach to assess post-restoration spatiotemporal changes in the peatland water table (WT) with optical (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 7–9) and radar (Sentinel-1) imagery. We tested the approach in eleven northern boreal peatlands (six restored, and five control sites) impacted by forestry drainage in northern Finland using Google Earth Engine cloud computing capabilities. We constructed a random forest regression model with spatiotemporal field-measured WT data as a dependent variable and satellite imagery features as independent variables. To assess the spatiotemporal changes, we constructed representative maps for situations before and after restoration, separately for early summer high-water and midsummer low-water conditions. To further quantify temporal changes during 2015–2023 and to test their statistical significance, we conducted a bootstrap hypothesis test for the areas near the restoration measures and similar areas in the control sites. The regression model had a relatively good fit and explanatory capacity (overall R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 6.01 cm), while there were notable site-specific variations. The WT maps showed that the post-restoration changes were not uniform and concentrated near the restoration measures. The bootstrap test showed that the WT increased more in the restored areas (4.7–8.8 cm) than in the control areas (0.1–5.2 cm).

In this paper we apply these technologies, along with machine learning, to the mapping of peatlands–a landcover class that is critical for preserving biodiversity, helping to address climate change impacts, and providing ecosystem services, e.g., carbon storage–in the Boreal Forest Natural Region of Alberta, Canada. We outline a data-driven, scientific framework that: compiles large amounts of Earth observation data sets (radar, optical, and LiDAR); examines the extracted variables for suitability in peatland modelling; optimizes model parameterization; and finally, predicts peatland occurrence across a large boreal area (397, 958 km2) of Alberta at 10 m spatial resolution (equalling 3.9 billion pixels across Alberta). The resulting peatland occurrence model shows an accuracy of 87% and a kappa statistic of 0.57 when compared to our validation data set. Differentiating peatlands from mineral wetlands achieved an accuracy of 69% and kappa statistic of 0.37. This data-driven approach is applicable at large geopolitical scales (e.g., provincial, national) for wetland and landcover inventories that support long-term, responsible resource management.","2019-06-17","2025-11-18 19:46:01","2025-11-18 19:46:01","","e0218165","","6","14","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considerable investment is therefore directed for restoring their carbon sequestration potential through large-scale rewetting/rehabilitation. However, rapid need to transform their carbon dynamics contrasts with millennial timescales over which peat profiles that control key ecohydrological processes within these ecosystems have developed. This study demonstrates the sensitivity of vadose zone hydrology of northern peatlands to hydrophysical properties of the very near-surface peat layer and therefore the potential capability of at least some ecohydrological processes to respond rapidly to developments in peat properties as a result of restoration. HYDRUS 1-D Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken of near-surface peat layers of various species and depths overlying degraded peat layer during periods of sustained drying. The modelling results showed that shallow additions of newly developed Sphagnum peat, just a couple of centimetres in depth, substantially modified near-surface hydrology of peat profiles and significantly altered the time taken for reaching important ecohydrological pressure heads. Whilst a degraded peat layer reached threshold pressure head (TP) of ?100?cm in 119?h, addition of 2.5-cm layer of S. magellancium reduced the average time to TP by 18?hours, whilst S. fuscum and amalgamated Sphagnum overlying degraded peat across initial WTDs (5, 10, 15 and 20?cm) increased average time to TP by 304 and 540?h, respectively. This demonstrates that whilst peat hydrophysical properties have developed over millennia, ecohydrological dynamics of these systems rapidly adjusted through restoration approaches in response to disturbances.","2022-09-01","2025-11-18 19:51:34","2025-11-18 19:51:34","2025-11-18","e2445","","6","15","","Ecohydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","wetland; Sphagnum; peatlands; ecohydrological thresholds; HYDRUS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bryophytes occupy 80–100% of the ground layer in these site types and form an important part of the accumulated organic matter. Bryophytes are small plants that occur in microhabitats that are an integral part of the surrounding plant community. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the establishment of bryophytes at an experimental wetland (Sandhill Wetland-SHW) by assessing the changing vegetation and substrate regimes over eight years after wet-up. Included in this analysis is an account of the ground layer flora between 2014 and 2021 along with evaluation of associated environmental factors. At SHW, a number of peatland bryophytes initially established in numerous areas across the wetland. However, in subsequent years increasing water tables with expanding Typha-dominating areas, high sedge productivity along with increasing vascular plant cover, and increasing sodicity have reduced the microhabitats available for bryophytes, with the result being a much-diminished set of peatland bryophyte species. We suggest that future reclamation designs for fens should include microhabitats for bryophytes, as bryophytes are foundational species and integral to fen development. In comparison, reclamation designs for non-peat forming ecosystems that do not have abundant bryophytes, such as marshes and saline wetlands, do not require these microhabitat conditions. Installing a recently harvested peat substrate appears to provide suitable conditions for early establishment of bryophytes.","2023-04-01","2025-11-18 19:54:07","2025-11-18 19:54:07","","297-307","","2","31","","Wetlands Ecology and Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road (TCWR), traversing subarctic Canada, is the busiest heavy-haul road in the world with as many as 10,900 truckloads per season. In addition to lake-ice thickness, trafficability on the TCWR depends upon adequate freezeback of overland portages, which are primarily peatlands underlain by discontinuous permafrost. We investigate threshold requirements for the initiation of winter road operations in this region and assess the use of a recommended 305 °C-day air-freezing index (FDD305a) value as an operational predictor of ground freezing at 30 cm depth, the desired depth to allow winter road construction to commence. Snow compaction and flooding were found to enhance freezeback of portages with early winter overland flow having a similar effect. The majority of winter road portages were not adequately frozen to a depth of 30 cm by FDD305a. Our results indicate that for drained and wet peatlands in this discontinuous permafrost environment, an FDDa threshold of 1100 °C-days is more appropriate than the 305 °C-day threshold. However, TCWR winter road operators presently plan the construction of the winter road by a calendar date rather than by evaluation of the air-freezing index. This practice results in a conservative approach to the start of the construction season, close to 1100 °C-days with a higher percentage of sites frozen to 30 cm depth than would be if the 305 °C-day air-freezing index was used as a guideline. In addition, the use of low-pressure vehicles for snow compaction during the start of the construction season is an effective adaptation practice to accelerate freezing penetration.","2020-02-01","2025-11-18 19:54:56","2025-11-18 19:54:56","","102930","","","170","","Cold Regions Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Freezing index; Guidelines; Overflow; Permafrost; Winter roads","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In western Lake Superior, early signs of invasion into sedge-dominated peatlands along the Kakagon and Bad Rivers, owned and managed by the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, were noticed in the early 1990s. In 1998, we began tracking expansion of Typha patches and assessing causes and ramifications. Perimeters of patches were delineated with GPS, with repeat delineations in 2005 and 2013. At the Kakagon site, permanent transects were established tangential to the 1998 patch perimeters and perpendicular to those transects, extending into the cattails and outward into sedges. Plant communities were sampled along transects in all years. Transects across stands of non-invasive Typha latifolia were sampled for comparisons but showed little change. In 2005, area encompassed by the Kakagon River patches increased by 66% from 1998; increase was 143% by 2013. The Bad River patches increased by 25% in 2005; further analyses were not possible because some patches had coalesced. Across years, mean Importance Value (IV) for invasive Typha increased for all tangential and perpendicular transects, reflecting expansion into adjacent sedge meadow. Among changes in other species, mean IV for dominant sedge Carex lasiocarpa also decreased on both transects. Typha invasion seems to be directional and not cyclical in relation to lake-level changes, which might have future influence. Given the tendency for early Typha expansion, land managers should scout for new patches and begin treatment soon after discovery.","2023-02-01","2025-11-18 19:55:45","2025-11-18 19:55:45","","18","","2","43","","Wetlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Resource exploration activities are currently having profound effects on hydrological and ecological processes in sub-arctic peatlands. In wetland-dominated zones of discontinuous permafrost, permafrost occurs below tree-covered peat plateaus where the tree-canopy and vadose zone act to insulate and preserve permafrost below. Linear disturbances such as seismic lines result in removal of the canopy, and cause permafrost thaw, which results in increased soil moisture, land subsidence, and deforestation. This contributes to land-cover transformation, habitat and vegetation loss, and changes to basin hydrologic cycles. The resultant permafrost-degraded corridors comprise large portions of the drainage density of sub-arctic basins, and alter the region's water and energy balances. Mulching over disturbances, with the removed tree canopy, has been proposed as a best management practice to help reduce this environmental impact. Here we present climate chamber and numerical modeling results which quantify the effects of mulching and its ability to limit permafrost thaw and alterations to the ground thermal regime. Overall, the thermal buffering ability of the mulch had beneficial effects on slowing thaw, due to its low thermal conductivity, which decouples the subsurface from meteorological forcing and impedes heat conduction. Results indicate that mulching is an effective technique to reduce permafrost thaw and provides a scientific basis to assess the mitigation measure on its ability to slow permafrost degradation. This study will provide guidance as to how northern exploration may be performed in a more environmentally sustainable manner.","2017-05-01","2025-11-18 20:03:09","2025-11-18 20:03:09","","207-223","","","102","","Ecological Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Peat; Permafrost; Climate chamber; Ecohydrology; Heat and water movement; Linear disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With climate change, peatland C mineralization is expected to increase, which in turn would accelerate climate change. A particularity of peatlands is the importance of soil aeration, which regulates peatland functioning and likely modulates the responses to warming climate. Our aim is to assess the impacts of warming on a southern boreal and a sub-arctic sedge fen carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange under two plausible water table regimes: wet and moderately dry. We focused this study on minerotrophic treeless sedge fens, as they are common peatland types at boreal and (sub)arctic areas, which are expected to face the highest rates of climate warming. In addition, fens are expected to respond to environmental changes faster than the nutrient poor bogs. Our study confirmed that CO2 exchange is more strongly affected by drying than warming. Experimental water level draw-down (WLD) significantly increased gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration. Warming alone had insignificant impacts on the CO2 exchange components, but when combined with WLD it further increased ecosystem respiration. In the southern fen, CO2 uptake decreased due to WLD, which was amplified by warming, while at northern fen it remained stable. As a conclusion, our results suggest that a very small difference in the WLD may be decisive, whether the C sink of a fen decreases, or whether the system is able to adapt within its regime and maintain its functions. Moreover, the water table has a role in determining how much the increased temperature impacts the CO2 exchange.","2019-06-01","2025-11-18 20:03:38","2025-11-18 20:03:38","2025-11-18","1995-2008","","6","25","","Global Change Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","peatland; carbon dioxide; ecosystem respiration; gross photosynthesis; OTC; warming; water level drawdown","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, climate change may increase wildfire intensity and frequency, potentially shifting wetlands to less wildfire resistant states. Peatlands formed by infilling generally undergo a succession from open water to grounded peat, with spatially complex intermediate states which may impact wildfire resistance. We explored the relationship between wetland successional states and fire severity following a > 11,000 ha wildfire in Ontario’s Boreal Shield landscape. We digitized 144 wetlands of varying successional states from aerial imagery and assessed fire severity using the Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio calculated from Sentinel-2A satellite imagery. Completely peat-filled wetlands were small in area (0.7 ± 2 ha) but were most frequent on the landscape (n = 99/144) compared to a smaller number (n = 8) of large (19 ± 2 ha) spatially complex wetlands that comprised > 30% of the total wetland area. In wetlands covered completely, or nearly completely, by peat, fire severity was significantly higher compared to wetlands with interspersed patches of shallow open water. Moreover, > 90% of fire resistant wetlands with open water were associated with beaver dams. Wetlands with more complex surface cover experienced lower mean fire severity but greater variability in fire severity suggesting that variable fuel configuration (i.e., spatially heterogeneous surface cover) in complex wetlands limit wildfire propagation across the wetland surface. Our findings are important for landscape conservation and wildfire management, as spatially complex wetlands host a diverse array of habitats for at-risk species and may offer protection from severe wildfires as fire refugia.","2022-10-10","2025-11-18 20:04:14","2025-11-18 20:04:14","","87","","7","42","","Wetlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Restoration significantly reduced discharge from the site, transforming peat pans into pools. These retained surface water over half the time and were deeper during wet periods than before. In the surrounding haggs water tables stabilised, as drawdown during dry conditions reduced, increasing the saturated peat thickness. Despite these changes, there were no effects on photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration or dissolved organic carbon loads leaving the site.
